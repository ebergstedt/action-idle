# Sabertooth (Rare)

## Overview

The Sabertooth is a larger Heavy Tank that can equip armaments to assist in combat. With relatively high HP and single-target damage output, Sabertooths excel in the early to mid-game as effective tanks that can deal significant damage to medium and giant ground targets.

This rare unit is best used as a midgame support unit (rounds 3-5). You usually get 2-3 in the right situation to get through rounds 3-5 comfortably. The Sabertooth is not a carry unit - you don't build more than 2-3 and usually don't tech them with more than 1 tech.

### Weapon Mechanics

**Attack Type:** High-caliber explosive shell

**Combat Characteristics:**
- **High Alpha Damage:** 7,858 damage per shot is devastating against medium units
- **Slow Fire Rate:** 3.4 second attack interval limits sustained DPS
- **Splash Damage:** 6m splash radius hits clustered enemies
- **Single Entity:** All HP concentrated in one target

**DPS Breakdown:**
- Base damage: 7,858 per shot
- Attack interval: 3.4 seconds
- Base DPS: 7,858 / 3.4 = 2,311 DPS
- Splash range: 5m
- Double Shot tech: Fires 2 shells, +12% reload time = ~4,100 effective DPS

**Projectile Mechanics:**
- Medium-speed ballistic projectile
- Can be intercepted by Missile Interceptor on other units
- Splash radius allows hitting multiple clustered targets

**Missile Interceptor Tech:**
- Intercepts enemy missiles within 150m range
- One Sabertooth can neutralize approximately one Stormcaller
- Interception efficiency degrades with sustained use
- Note: Interception is independent of Sabertooth's attack and level

**Double Shot Tech:**
- Fires 2 shells per attack in succession
- Reload time increased by 12%
- Extremely cost-effective at only 100 supply
- Best tech for tempo and economy value

**Field Entrenchment Tech:**
- Deploys trench at battle start
- While entrenched: Cannot move, +70% HP, +30 Range
- Leaves trench if no enemies in range for 7 seconds
- Turns Sabertooth into stationary high-HP turret

**Culling Rounds Tech:**
- Attacks instantly destroy targets with current HP below 300
- Threshold increases +300 per Sabertooth level
- Level 1: <300 HP, Level 2: <600 HP, Level 3: <900 HP
- ATK reduced by 50%

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Double Shot** | 100 | Each attack fires 2 shells in succession but increases reload time by 12%. Crazy tempo unit tech. |
| **Missile Interceptor** | 200 | Intercepts enemy missiles within 150m. One Sabertooth can interrupt approximately one Stormcaller. |
| **Field Maintenance** | 300 | Increases HP by 30%, automatically restores 4.5% Max HP per second upon taking damage. |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Increases attack range by 40m. |
| **Field Entrenchment** | (New) | Deploys trench at battle start. While entrenched: cannot move, HP +70%, Range +30. Leaves trench if no enemies in range for 7s. |
| **Culling Rounds** | (New) | Attacks instantly destroy targets with current HP below 300 (+300 per additional level). |

### Tech Analysis

**Double Shot** - At only 100 cost, this makes Sabertooth a crazy tempo unit. Picking this often gets you the most economy value from the unit pack, so it's always a solid choice. Great against giants and medium units.

**Missile Interceptor** - Very strong technology and maybe the main reason to get Sabertooths. One Sabertooth can interrupt approximately one Stormcaller. Note that interception efficiency is independent of Sabertooth's attack and level.

**Field Maintenance** - Good if you have some levels or items and the enemy doesn't have a Melting Point. Helps Sabertooths sustain as frontline tanks.

**Range Enhancement** - Not recommended as the primary tech. The guide suggests protecting your Sabertooth with chaff units rather than extending its range. Better to keep Sabertooths on the frontline.

**Field Entrenchment** - New tech that turns Sabertooth into a stationary turret with +70% HP and +30 range. Useful for defensive positioning but removes mobility.

**Culling Rounds** - New tech that executes low-HP targets. The threshold increases with Sabertooth level. Good for finishing off damaged units.

## Counters

### What Beats Sabertooths

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Fortress** | Hard Counter | Too tanky and powerful |
| **Melting Point** | Hard Counter | Laser shreds single entities |
| **Overlord** | Hard Counter | Air unit with massive damage |
| **Phoenix** | Hard Counter | Flying, can't be targeted |
| **Hacker** | Good Counter | Can hack Sabertooths |
| **Rhino** | Good Counter | Fast melee engagement |

### What Sabertooths Beat

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Arclight** | Hard Counter | Outranges and outdamages |
| **Stormcaller** | Hard Counter | With Missile Interceptor, shuts down Stormcallers |
| **Fire Badger** | Good Counter | Outranges short-range Fire Badgers |
| **Sledgehammer** | Good Counter | High damage vs medium tanks |
| **Steel Ball** | Good Counter | Trades well against Steel Balls |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Midgame Powerhouse** - A leveled Sabertooth with an item is always a big powerhouse early game. Get early levels on Sabertooths for devastating carry potential.

2. **Giant Killer** - A few Sabertooths with a level or two plus Double Shot and Range can murder low-level Giants. Often ends the game if the opponent tries to swap to giants. But you need to get them early and level them up.

3. **Frontline Position** - The Sabertooth is best used as a frontline tank. Don't position it too far back - protect it with chaff instead of teching Range.

### Defensive Use

1. **Missile Defense** - With Missile Interceptor, Sabertooths provide excellent defense against Stormcallers. One Sabertooth can neutralize approximately one Stormcaller.

2. **Tank Role** - Use Sabertooths to absorb damage while your damage dealers work. Field Maintenance helps with sustain.

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Build:**
1. Double Shot (for tempo and economy value)

**Anti-Stormcaller Build:**
1. Missile Interceptor

**Sustain Build (with levels/items):**
1. Field Maintenance

**Giant Killer Build:**
1. Double Shot
2. Range Enhancement

### General Advice

- Usually you don't tech anything and just sell Sabertooths later, but Missile Interceptor is a very solid choice against Stormcallers.
- Field Maintenance is good if you have some levels or items and the enemy doesn't have a Melting Point.
- They do extremely well vs Tanks and Arclights, okay vs Steel Balls, okay vs Mustangs, okay vs Farseer, and not bad vs Stormcallers.
- Sabertooths are rare units - you cannot reliably build strategies around them since they're only available from unit packs.
- Don't over-invest in Sabertooths. Usually 2-3 units with at most 1 tech is the sweet spot.
- Double Shot with Secondary Armament is good against Hound and Void Eye.

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Mustang** | Excellent | Mustangs provide anti-air while Sabertooths handle ground threats |
| **Fang** | Good | Anti-air coverage for ground-only Sabertooths |
| **Crawler** | Good | Chaff protects Sabertooths while they deal damage |

## Strengths

- High HP and single-target damage output
- Excellent midgame support unit (rounds 3-5)
- Double Shot provides crazy tempo for only 100 supply
- Missile Interceptor can neutralize Stormcallers
- Leveled Sabertooth with item is an early game powerhouse
- Can murder low-level Giants with proper techs
- A-tier unit in tier lists
- Trades well against multiple unit types

## Weaknesses

- Rare unit - only obtainable from unit packs
- Cannot attack air units
- Single-entity vulnerability to Melting Point and Hackers
- Not a carry unit - don't over-invest
- Best used as midgame support, scales poorly late game
- Hard countered by Fortress
