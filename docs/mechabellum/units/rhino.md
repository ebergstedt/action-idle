# Rhino

## Overview

The Rhino is a fast, durable melee unit that charges into enemy units to deal devastating damage at close range with its dual sawblade arms. Rhinos are the only Single-Entity unit currently in the game that's strictly melee, meaning they must reach the target before they can unleash their onslaught.

Rhinos excel at destroying small groups of units (Sledgehammers, Steel Balls) as well as single targets (Vulcans). Their attacks are powerful with reasonably high attack speed, and their small area of effect makes them decent at killing high unit-count squads like Fangs. Surprise is the Rhino's greatest strength.

### Weapon Mechanics

**Attack Type:** Melee dual sawblade arms

**Combat Characteristics:**
- **Pure Melee:** Must physically reach target before dealing any damage
- **High Attack Speed:** 0.9 second attack interval for a heavy hitter
- **Small AOE:** Sawblade attacks hit a small area around the target
- **High Base Speed:** 16 m/s allows rapid engagement

**DPS Breakdown:**
- Base damage: 3,560 per hit
- Attack interval: 0.9 seconds
- Base DPS: 3,560 / 0.9 = 3,956 DPS
- One of the highest sustained DPS units in the game when in melee range

**Life Drain Mechanic - Wreckage Recycling:**
- **NOT** traditional life steal (does not heal on damage dealt)
- Heals on **kill** for HP equal to the killed enemy's HP
- Also increases ATK by 20%
- Example: Killing a Fortress (~50,000 HP) restores Rhino to full health
- Best against medium units (Sledgehammers) - high enough HP to matter, low enough to kill
- Less effective vs chaff (too little HP restored) or giants (hard to kill)

**Whirlwind Mechanic:**
- Activates when surrounded by multiple enemies
- Deals 1.5x damage (5,340) to ALL surrounding enemies
- **Whirlwind Radius:** Equivalent to 4x normal AOE (length of 16 Crawlers)
- **Whirlwind Attack Interval:** 1.0 second
- Transforms Rhino from single-target to effective AOE damage
- Essential for dealing with chaff and multi-unit squads
- Rhino always uses Whirlwind when multiple enemies are in range

**Final Blitz (Self-Destruct):**
- Triggers at 0 HP
- Deals damage equal to Rhino's Max HP within 48m radius
- Base explosion: 19,297 damage in massive area
- Scales with HP-boosting techs (Power Armor +25% HP = bigger explosion)

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Wreckage Recycling** | 100 | Upon destroying an enemy, recovers HP equal to enemy's HP. |
| **Armor Enhancement** | 200 | HP +50% and 60 damage blocked (+60/rank). More effective vs high fire-rate units (Mustangs). |
| **Mechanical Rage** | 200 | Increases movement speed by 5 m/s and reduces attack interval by 0.3s. Most important for Rhino rushes. |
| **Final Blitz** | 250 | Activates self-destruct at 0 HP, dealing damage equal to Rhino's Max HP within 48m radius. A must-pick. |
| **Whirlwind** | 250 | When multiple enemies around, uses Whirlwind attack dealing 1.5x damage to all surrounding enemies over a long time. |
| **Photon Coating** | 300 | Reduces damage by 30% for first 16s, grants immunity to electromagnetic, ignition, degenerate beam, and acid effects. |
| **Field Maintenance** | 300 | Automatically restores 4.5% Max HP per second upon taking damage. |
| **Power Armor** | 300 | Increases HP by 25% and grants immunity to slow. Counters Sentry Missiles. |

### Tech Analysis

**Wreckage Recycling** - For such a low cost (100), it ups the power level of your Rhinos considerably. The HP recovery from kills helps sustain through multiple engagements.

**Armor Enhancement** - Works differently on Rhinos than other units. Rhinos don't receive an HP increase, only the damage shield (60 per level). More effective against high fire-rate units like Mustangs.

**Mechanical Rage** - If you're doing Rhino rushes with Mobile Beacon, this is the most important tech. The movement speed increase is relevant in many situations, letting Rhinos close distance faster and attack more frequently.

**Final Blitz (Self-Destruct)** - Gives so much flexibility that it's a must-pick. Turns a late Rhino drop into a little nuke or punishes opponents for good counters that aren't instant. Even when countered, the self-destruct can deal massive damage.

**Whirlwind** - Insane against Crawlers, Fangs, Sledgehammers, Mustangs, and other multi-unit squads. When surrounded by multiple enemies, the 1.5x damage to all surrounding units is devastating.

**Photon Coating** - Brings Rhino's power level up significantly. Usually the first or second tech. The 30% damage reduction for the first 25s helps Rhinos survive the charge, and immunity to debuffs prevents being slowed or burned.

**Power Armor** - Main benefit is countering Sentry Missiles which otherwise slow your Rhino. Also helps in base races as your Rhinos become immune to the slow from your tower dying.

**Field Maintenance** - Sometimes insane if you get high-level Rhinos from unit drops, but usually not recommended since Rhinos get countered by Steel Balls or Melting Points anyway.

## Counters

### What Beats Rhinos

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Melting Point** | Hard Counter | Rhino's worst nightmare. No matter what upgrades you take. |
| **Fortress** | Hard Counter | Tanks and outdamages Rhinos |
| **Hacker** | Good Counter | Loses 1v1 but with support becomes excellent counter |
| **Steel Ball** | Good Counter | Scales much better; you may lose one round but win the game |
| **Phoenix** | Good Counter | Flying, can kite and kill |
| **Overlord** | Good Counter | Air unit with massive damage |
| **War Factory** | Good Counter | Outclasses Rhinos entirely |

### What Rhinos Beat

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Arclight** | Hard Counter | Closes distance and destroys stationary artillery |
| **Vulcan** | Hard Counter | Fast engagement, high damage |
| **Stormcaller** | Hard Counter | Fast enough to outrun rockets, destroys at close range |
| **Crawler** | Hard Counter | With Whirlwind, devastating AOE |
| **Sledgehammer** | Good Counter | High damage shreds medium tanks |
| **Fire Badger** | Good Counter | Closes distance before they can react |
| **Marksman** | Good Counter | Can't escape Rhino charge |
| **Mustang** | Good Counter | Closes distance and overwhelms |
| **Typhoon** | Good Counter | Slow, vulnerable to melee |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Surprise Attacks** - Surprise is the Rhino's greatest strength. Unexpected Rhino deployments catch opponents off-guard and can win rounds.

2. **Rhino Rush** - With Mobile Beacon and Mechanical Rage, Rhinos can close distance extremely fast and devastate backline units.

3. **Level 3 Powerhouse** - A Level 3 Rhino is a powerhouse that requires an immediate answer. Invest in leveling Rhinos for devastating carry potential.

4. **Flanking** - Rhino's speed and damage make it an effective flanking unit. Attack artillery and backline from unexpected angles.

### Defensive Use

1. **Counter Artillery** - Rhinos counter slow, stationary units like Stormcallers and Marksmen. Position to punish artillery-heavy compositions.

2. **Final Blitz Zone Denial** - Even when a Rhino is dying, Final Blitz creates a massive damage zone. Position dying Rhinos to maximize self-destruct value.

### Tech Build Paths

**Rush Build:**
1. Mechanical Rage
2. Photon Coating
3. Final Blitz

**Standard Build:**
1. Photon Coating
2. Final Blitz
3. Whirlwind or Wreckage Recycling

**Anti-Chaff Build:**
1. Whirlwind
2. Photon Coating

**Sustain Build:**
1. Wreckage Recycling
2. Photon Coating

### General Advice

- Rhinos tend to run ahead of your other units, making them particularly susceptible to enemy Hackers.
- Shielded Fangs waste a lot of Rhino time, even with Whirlwind. If you're getting Rhino flanked, an early War Factory that shoots in all directions is very powerful.
- Steel Balls scale much better than Rhinos. You may lose one round to Steel Balls, but you will win the game in the long run.
- Don't rely solely on Rhinos - the Melting Point hard counters them regardless of upgrades.
- Power Armor is specifically useful against Sentry Missiles and in base race situations.

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Fang** | Excellent | Fangs provide anti-air support Rhinos lack |
| **Mustang** | Excellent | Mustangs handle air while Rhinos handle ground |
| **Wasp** | Good | Air support for ground-only Rhino |
| **Stormcaller** | Good | Rhinos protect artillery by engaging fast threats |

## Strengths

- Fastest Single-Entity unit (strictly melee)
- Devastating melee damage with sawblades
- Small AOE on attacks helps against squads
- Fast enough to outrun Stormcaller and Overlord rockets
- Surprise is the greatest weapon
- Final Blitz provides value even in death
- Level 3 Rhino is a game-changing powerhouse
- Effective flanking unit

## Weaknesses

- Short range - must charge into enemy fire to attack
- Cannot attack air units at all
- Hard countered by Melting Point
- Susceptible to Hackers due to tendency to run ahead
- Requires support from other units to handle air
- Becomes harder to close distance as game progresses
- Single-Entity vulnerability
