# Wasp

## Overview

The Wasp light aircraft is quite aptly named. By itself, a single Wasp can't hurt you, but in a group, they're absolutely terrifying. These nimble flying units can be played in many different ways depending on the board state and technology choices.

Wasps excel in the late game, serving as the perfect counter for mass Overlord or Wraith strategies. They are notoriously deadly against Squad units - none of the Squad units currently in the game have an appropriate response to Wasps.

## Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Cost** | 200 Supply |
| **Unlock Cost** | 50 Supply |
| **Unit Count** | 6 per squad |
| **HP per Unit** | 550 (estimated) |
| **Total Squad HP** | 3,300 (estimated) |
| **Damage per Shot** | 45 (estimated) |
| **Attack Interval** | 0.5 seconds (estimated) |
| **DPS per Unit** | 90 (estimated) |
| **Squad DPS** | 540 (estimated) |
| **Range** | 55m (short, "critically short") |

| **Target** | Air and Ground |
| **Attack Type** | Projectile (rapid-fire cannon) |
| **Splash Radius** | None (single-target) |

### Weapon Mechanics

**Attack Type:** Rapid-fire projectile cannon (air-to-ground/air-to-air)

**Combat Characteristics:**
- **Fragility:** Very low HP - dies in one hit from Sentry Missiles at Level 1
- **Short Range:** Base range of ~55m is described as "critically short"
- **Rapid Fire:** High rate of fire similar to Fangs/Mustangs
- **Flight:** Flying unit - immune to ground-only attacks

**Damage Profile:**
- Individual Wasps deal moderate damage
- Squad damage is significant when all 6 units are alive
- DPS drops rapidly as Wasps are killed due to low individual HP

**Tech Effects on Stats:**
- **Jump Drive:** +5 m/s movement speed
- **Ground Specialization:** +200% ATK vs ground units
- **Aerial Specialization:** +75% ATK vs air units, +30m range vs air
- **Energy Shield:** Shield equal to HP (blocks at least one hit)
- **Elite Marksman:** +5m range and +25% ATK per level (up to +90% at Level 3)
- **Improved Wasps Card:** +60% base stats, +20m range, +50% cost

**Key Limitation:** The short base range means Wasps must get dangerously close to deal damage, exposing them to anti-air fire

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Jump Drive** | 50 | Increases movement speed by 5 m/s, allows free repositioning during deployment. |
| **High-Explosive Ammo** | 150 | Increases splash damage range by 7m, reduces ATK by 40%. |
| **Ground Specialization** | 200 | ATK increases by 200% to ground units. |
| **Aerial Specialization** | 200 | Attack against air units increased by 75%, range when attacking air units increased by 30m. |
| **Ignite** | 200 | Attacks have a chance to ignite the target. Ignited units lose 6% HP per second for 2s. |
| **Armor-Piercing Bullets** | 200 | Increases ATK by 50%. |
| **Electromagnetic Shot** | 200 | Disables target tech and reduces movement speed by 40%. |
| **Energy Shield** | 300 | Obtain an energy shield that absorbs damage equal to HP, blocks at least one instance of damage. |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Increases attack range by 40m. |
| **Elite Marksman** | 300 | Increases range by 5m and ATK by 25% per level. Final upgrade for Wasps. |

### Tech Analysis

**Jump Drive** - Very effective early game for harassment with Mobile Beacon. Allows aggressive positioning, flanking, and repositioning against enemy Rhinos. Extremely cheap at 50 supply.

**Ground Specialization** - With 200% bonus to ground and Range tech, Wasps trade pretty well against even Mustangs. Use when focusing on ground targets.

**Aerial Specialization + Range** - The core anti-air build. You may struggle in midgame vs Wraith, but once you get Range + Aerial Spec going, you defeat them easily.

**Energy Shield** - The reality is that if something connects to your Wasps, they will die. Shields don't really solve this issue. Even when using Wasps as chaff against Mustangs, the shield doesn't matter much. It costs a tech slot that could go to better options.

**Elite Marksman** - The final upgrade for Wasps. The damage increase stacks per unit level (up to 90% at Level 3). Take this on high-level carry Wasps.

**Recommended Air Superiority Build:** Aerial Specialization, Range, Shields, and Electromagnetic Shot.

## Counters

### What Beats Wasps

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Mustang** | Hard Counter | A single Mustang unit can wipe multiple unupgraded Wasp units |
| **Overlord** | Hard Counter | Slow attacks but massive AOE damage instantly wipes Wasps |
| **Fortress** | Good Counter | With Anti-air Barrage, best mid/late game option |
| **Fang** | Good Counter | Can shoot down Wasps effectively |
| **Wraith** | Good Counter | Air-to-air specialist |
| **Typhoon** | Good Counter | AOE damage |
| **Tarantula** | Good Counter | With Anti-Aircraft tech |

### What Wasps Beat

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Marksman** | Hard Counter | No appropriate response to air attacks |
| **Melting Point** | Hard Counter | Single-target ground laser can't hit air |
| **Vulcan** | Hard Counter | Struggles against fast air units |
| **Overlord** | Good Counter | With proper upgrades, can overwhelm Overlords |
| **Phoenix** | Good Counter | Can tank Phoenix damage or kill them with Aerial Spec |
| **All Squad Units** | Good Counter | None have appropriate response to Wasps |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Early Game Harassment** - Use Jump Drive and Mobile Beacon for harassment. Very effective if the enemy has holes in their defense.

2. **Multi-Direction Attack** - Never attack with only a single unit of Wasps - that's how you get them killed. Attack with multiple units from multiple directions. It only takes a single Mustang unit to counter you.

3. **Main Damage Dealer** - Wasps can serve as your main damage unit with insane damage from Ground/Air specializations. However, they're very squishy and need a solid frontline for protection. Get early levels on Wasps so they become a menace with items.

4. **Missile Block** - Use Wasps to block sentry missiles. The missiles have big splash radius, and if you have clumped ground units who would all die, tank the missile with Wasps - splash only hits air units.

### Defensive Use

1. **Flank Defense** - Wasps are very strong flank defenders if the enemy has committed multiple units to your flank. They fend off most units and fly to battle fast afterward.

2. **Transition Defense** - Later in the game, add Rhinos or Steel Balls in front of Wasps to power through defenses. Or switch to defensive formation, Jump Drive Wasps back, and tech shields to use them as meat shields.

### Tech Build Paths

**Air Superiority Build:**
1. Aerial Specialization
2. Range Enhancement
3. Energy Shield or Electromagnetic Shot

**Ground Attack Build:**
1. Ground Specialization
2. Range Enhancement
3. Elite Marksman

**Early Harassment Build:**
1. Jump Drive

**Carry Wasp Build:**
1. Range Enhancement
2. Elite Marksman
3. Appropriate Specialization

### General Advice

- Against Mustangs: Don't go Aerial Specialization first - always go Range first. Range enables a Mustang to survive and still kill a low-HP Wasp.
- Wasps scale into the late game very well.
- They are good vs leveled Marksmen and Melting Points in particular.
- In mid and late game, Fortresses with Anti-air Barrage is the best counter option because Wasps are often paired with a mobile frontline like Steel Balls.

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Steel Ball** | Excellent | Mobile frontline that protects Wasps while they deal damage |
| **Rhino** | Excellent | Fast frontline to power through defenses |
| **Mustang** | Good | Both cover each other's weaknesses |
| **Fortress** | Good | Solid frontline protection |

## Strengths

- Extremely deadly against Squad units
- Scales very well into late game
- Perfect counter for mass Overlord or Wraith strategies
- Flying provides natural protection from many ground units
- Can target both air and ground
- Fast movement allows quick repositioning
- Versatile tech options for different situations
- Good vs leveled Marksmen and Melting Points

## Weaknesses

- Very squishy - if something connects, they die
- Hard countered by Mustangs
- Overlords deal devastating AOE damage
- A single Mustang unit can counter multiple unupgraded Wasp units
- Require protection from frontline units
- Need multiple units attacking from multiple directions to be effective
