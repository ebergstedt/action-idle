# Tarantula

## Overview

The Tarantula is a heavily armored unit that can withstand significant damage. Its two rapid-fire autocannons are very effective against small and medium-sized units. Tarantulas have a couple of things going for them: they're very tanky and besides clearing chaff very well in early game, they deal decent damage against Sledgehammers and Arclights.

Look to use Tarantulas against boards heavy in chaff that also have Arclights or Sledgehammers. However, be aware that Tarantulas scale very poorly - they're a good early game unit but become very weak later on.

## Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Cost** | 200 Supply |
| **Unlock Cost** | Free (starting unit pool) |
| **Unit Count** | 1 (Single Entity) |
| **HP** | 14,773 |
| **Damage per Shot** | 496 |
| **Attack Interval** | 0.6 seconds |
| **DPS** | 827 |
| **Range** | 80m |
| **Speed** | 8 m/s |
| **Target** | Ground Only (Air with Anti-Aircraft Ammunition tech) |
| **Attack Type** | Dual Autocannons (rapid-fire) |
| **Splash Radius** | 5m |

### Weapon Mechanics

**Attack Type:** Dual rapid-fire autocannons

**Combat Characteristics:**
- **Dual Weapons:** Two autocannons fire in alternating pattern
- **High Fire Rate:** 0.6 second attack interval provides excellent sustained damage
- **Small Splash:** Each shot has small AOE, effective vs clustered chaff
- **Single Entity:** All 14,773 HP in one target - vulnerable to single-target attacks

**DPS Breakdown:**
- Base damage: 496 per shot
- Attack interval: 0.6 seconds
- Base DPS: 496 / 0.6 = 827 DPS
- With High-Explosive Ammo: +5m splash, -30% ATK = ~579 DPS but better chaff clear

**Spider Mine Tech Mechanics:**
- Fires 2 Spider Mines every 15 seconds
- Mine HP: 750 (increases +750 per Tarantula level)
- Mine Damage: 4,500 in 9m radius (increases +4,500 per level)
- Mines charge at enemies and self-destruct on contact
- Mines also serve as chaff, absorbing enemy fire

**Spider Mine Scaling (per Tarantula Level):**
| Level | Mine HP | Mine Damage |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | 750 | 4,500 |
| 2 | 1,500 | 9,000 |
| 3 | 2,250 | 13,500 |

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **High-Explosive Ammo** | 150 | Increases splash damage range by 5m, reduces ATK by 30%. Good chaff clear vs Crawlers and Fangs. |
| **Anti-Aircraft Ammunition** | 150 | Enables attacks against aerial units. |
| **Armor Enhancement** | 200 | Reduces damage received by 60 per level, increases HP by 35%. Cheap and good vs Mustangs. |
| **Armor-Piercing Bullets** | 200 | Increases ATK by 50%. |
| **Spider Mine** | 300 | Fires 2 Spider Mines with 750 HP every 15s. Mines charge at enemies and self-destruct, dealing 4,500 damage within 9m radius. Stats enhance with level. |
| **Field Maintenance** | 300 | Increases HP by 30%, automatically restores 4.5% Max HP per second upon taking damage. |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Increases attack range by 40m. |
| **Mechanical Rage** | 400 | Increases movement speed by 4 m/s and reduces attack interval by 0.2s. Expensive but powerful. |

### Tech Analysis

**Spider Mine** - The best technology for Tarantulas. If you commit into them, this is the power spike technology. It clears Crawlers, medium-sized units, and even enemy towers. The mines also serve as chaff, taking heavy hits that would otherwise hit your Tarantulas. Stats scale with Tarantula level (HP +750, damage +4,500 per rank).

**Armor Enhancement** - One of the stronger technologies for Tarantulas. Since the unit's main purpose is to tank, armor makes them incredibly durable. A couple of Level 2 Tarantulas with Armor tech become nearly unkillable early game, forcing enemies to deploy expensive counters. Very cheap and effective vs Mustang-heavy boards.

**High-Explosive Ammo** - Cheap and effective chaff clear technology. Helps a lot against both Crawlers and Fangs, especially loose Crawlers and shielded Fangs.

**Mechanical Rage** - Expensive tech that allows Tarantulas to connect faster due to movement speed and deal more damage with reduced attack interval. The attack interval reduction significantly increases chaff clear.

**Anti-Aircraft Ammunition** - Enables air targeting. Situational but can be useful if you need anti-air and are committed to Tarantulas.

**Range Enhancement** - Usually range techs are very strong, but with Tarantulas you want to make use of their high HP pool. You want them walking forward and tanking damage, not staying in the backline.

**Field Maintenance** - Good for sustaining Tarantulas that serve as frontline tanks for your army.

### What Tarantulas Beat

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Fang** | Hard Counter | Autocannons shred chaff |
| **Crawler** | Hard Counter | Excellent chaff clear |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Early Game Pressure** - Tarantulas are good early game units. If enemy has a very weak start against Tarantulas, push heavily with Spider Mines first and Range second.

2. **Chaff Clear** - Use Tarantulas to clear enemy Crawlers and Fangs while your other units deal with bigger threats.

3. **Spider Mine Push** - With Spider Mine tech, Tarantulas can clear paths and even damage towers. The mines provide additional chaff to absorb enemy fire.

### Defensive Use

1. **Frontline Tank** - Primary role is to tank damage. Walk them forward to absorb hits meant for your damage dealers.

2. **Anti-Mustang** - With Armor tech, Tarantulas punish Mustang-heavy boards cheaply.

### Tech Build Paths

**Push Build:**
1. Spider Mine
2. Range Enhancement

**Anti-Mustang Build:**
1. Armor Enhancement

**Chaff Clear Build:**
1. High-Explosive Ammo
2. Spider Mine

**Sustain Build:**
1. Field Maintenance
2. Armor Enhancement

### General Advice

- Tarantulas scale very poorly. They're good early game but become very bad later on.
- Don't invest too heavily in Tarantulas late game - the supply is better spent elsewhere.
- The unit is mostly used with Armor tech against Mustangs or Vulcans.
- If using as a frontline tank, focus on techs that increase survivability rather than range.
- Spider Mine is the power spike tech if you decide to commit to Tarantulas.

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Mustang** | Good | Tarantulas tank while Mustangs deal damage |
| **Marksman** | Good | Tarantulas frontline for squishy Marksmen |
| **Stormcaller** | Good | Tarantulas protect artillery from fast units |

## Strengths

- Very tanky with high HP
- Excellent chaff clear with dual autocannons
- Good against small and medium-sized units
- Armor tech makes them nearly unkillable early game
- Spider Mines provide excellent power spike
- Cheap Armor Enhancement counters Mustangs effectively
- Decent damage against Sledgehammers and Arclights

## Weaknesses

- Scales very poorly into late game
- Cannot attack air units without Anti-Aircraft tech
- Hard countered by many giant units
- Single-entity vulnerability to Melting Point and hackers
- Becomes much weaker as the game progresses
- Range techs not as useful since you want them tanking
