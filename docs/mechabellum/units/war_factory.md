# War Factory

## Overview

The War Factory is one of the strongest units in Mechabellum and has the highest stats on paper. This Titan Mobile Factory is an expensive and colossal unit that boasts immense durability and firepower.

The War Factory's main weapon is housed in four turrets along its hull that can independently engage different targets, potentially quadrupling its stated damage output. However, its turrets have limited arcs of fire - rear turrets cannot engage foes in front, and front turrets cannot engage foes behind.

**Important:** The War Factory is the only unit that incurs upkeep - 200 supplies are automatically deducted from your income at the start of each round for every War Factory you have on the field.

### Turret Mechanics

**Four Independent High-Power Cannons:**
- Main weapon housed in four turrets along hull
- Each turret has separate targeting cones
- Can independently engage different targets
- Potential to quadruple stated damage output vs multiple targets
- Typically only 2 turrets engage unless flanked or beaconed diagonally

**Turret Arc Limitations:**
- Front turrets cannot engage targets behind factory
- Rear turrets cannot engage targets in front
- Under normal positioning, rear turrets rarely active
- Diagonal beacon placement allows 50% more turret coverage (3 turrets)

**Positioning Strategy:**
- Leave 7x7 gaps in formation for War Factory placement
- Beacon at angle across enemy board for better turret coverage
- Aggressive positioning uses more turrets effectively

**Launcher Overload (Tech):**
- Attack interval reduced by 50% (0.9s)
- Range reduced by 20m (80m)
- Effectively doubles DPS output
- Best for aggressive factory builds

### Unit Production Mechanics

**Sledgehammer Production (Tech):**
- Produces 1 Sledgehammer every 6 seconds
- Produces up to 17 units per battle
- Sledgehammer speed matches War Factory (6 m/s)
- Units join battle together as a group
- Most efficient production tech (cost vs output)

**Steel Ball Production (Tech):**
- Produces 1 Steel Ball every 8.8 seconds
- Produces up to 11 units per battle
- Great chaff generation
- Synergizes with Mechanical Division tech on Steel Balls
- Good for aggressive pushes

**Phoenix Production (Tech):**
- Produces 1 Phoenix every 15.6 seconds
- Produces up to 7 units per battle
- Only anti-air production option
- Essential since War Factory cannot target air
- Slower production rate but valuable coverage

**Missile Interceptor (Tech):**
- Intercepts enemy missiles within 150m
- No efficiency decline over time (unlike AM Device)
- Best use case for War Factory
- Excellent flank protection

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Efficient Maintenance** | 50 | Upkeep cost reduced by 100 (from 200 to 100 per round). |
| **High-Explosive Ammo** | 150 | Splash damage range +5m, ATK -40%. |
| **Sledgehammer Production** | 250 | Produces 1 Sledgehammer every 4.6s (12 total per battle). |
| **Steel Ball Production** | 300 | Produces 1 Steel Ball every 6.5s (9 total per battle). |
| **Phoenix Production** | 350 | Produces 1 Phoenix every 13s (5 total per battle). |
| **Photon Coating** | 200 | Damage -30% for first 25s, immunity to EM, ignition, acid, and degeneration effects. |
| **Launcher Overload** | 200 | Attack interval -50%, range -20m. |
| **Missile Interceptor** | 250 | Intercepts enemy missiles within 150m. |
| **Armor Enhancement** | 200 | HP +50%, blocks 60 damage per hit (+60/level). |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Attack range +40m. |

*Note: Tech costs updated as of patch 1.8.1.1 which reduced costs for Photon Coating (400->300), Launcher Overload (400->350), and Missile Interceptor (400->350). Production intervals were increased in the same patch.*

### Tech Analysis

**Efficient Maintenance** - CRITICAL. Costs 200 supply but reduces upkeep from 200 to 50 per round. Do not buy War Factory before turn 5 unless you can immediately purchase this tech. The problem is it increases the effective cost of other technologies by 200.

**Sledgehammer Production** - Usually the best summoning tech. Summons the most units (17 total) and costs less than other production techs. Sledgehammers' speed matches War Factory (6 m/s), so they join battle together.

**Steel Ball Production** - Great chaff generation tool (11 total), especially with Mechanical Division tech on Steel Balls. Good for aggressive pushes.

**Phoenix Production** - The only anti-air production option (7 total). Essential since War Factory cannot target air itself.

**Missile Interceptor** - Best use case for War Factory. It intercepts missiles without efficiency decline over time (unlike AM Device). Excellent protection role.

**Photon Coating** - Protects against acid, fire, EMP, and degeneration effects for 30 seconds. Good vs Scorpion Acid.

**Range Enhancement** - Keeps factory safe after enemy counters it. Good vs acid and Melting Points.

**Launcher Overload** - Halves attack interval (1.8s -> 0.9s) but reduces range by 20m. Good for aggressive factory builds.

## Counters

### What Beats War Factory

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Scorpion (Acid)** | Hard Counter | Acid Attack + Range melts the factory |
| **Melting Point** | Hard Counter | Beam destroys even War Factory |
| **Crawler (Acid)** | Good Counter | 8 Acid Crawlers can defeat 1 War Factory |
| **Marksman** | Good Counter | Long-range single-target damage |
| **Phoenix** | Good Counter | Air unit, factory cannot target |

### What War Factory Beats

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Sandworm** | Hard Counter | Absolutely demolishes Sandworms |
| **Ground Giants** | Strong Counter | Massive HP and damage output |
| **Melee Units** | Strong Counter | Production line creates endless defenders |
| **Fortress** | Good Counter | Can out-trade with production support |
| **Ground Army** | Good Counter | Missile Intercept protects entire flank |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Aggressive Push** - Bring immense stats to frontline with Steel Ball Production for tower pressure and additional chaff.

2. **Missile Intercept** - Protects aggressive strategies from Stormcallers, Farseers, and Phantom Rays.

3. **Early Game Warning** - Do NOT buy War Factory before turn 5 unless you can immediately buy Efficient Maintenance.

### Defensive Use

1. **Flank Protection** - Position behind tower to protect flanks with Sledgehammer and Phoenix Production.

2. **Missile Defense** - Use Missile Intercept to protect your army from missile-based attacks.

3. **Production Factory** - Focus on Sledgehammer + Phoenix Production to churn out endless units.

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Build:**
1. Efficient Maintenance (FIRST - reduce upkeep)
2. Sledgehammer Production
3. Phoenix Production (anti-air coverage)

**Aggressive Push:**
1. Efficient Maintenance
2. Steel Ball Production
3. Missile Intercept (protect the push)
4. Launcher Overload

**Defensive Factory:**
1. Efficient Maintenance
2. Sledgehammer Production
3. Phoenix Production
4. Range Enhancement (stay safe)

**Anti-Scorpion Build:**
1. Efficient Maintenance
2. Range Enhancement
3. Photon Coating (anti-acid)

### Production Strategy

Two main strategies:

1. **Aggressive Factory** - Bring stats to frontline with Steel Ball Production. Missile Intercept protects other components of the strategy.

2. **Production Factory** - Position behind tower to protect flanks. Use Sledgehammer and Phoenix Production to churn out units continuously.

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Sledgehammer (Production)** | Excellent | Self-synergy with production tech |

- Hard countered by Scorpion Acid
- Hard countered by Melting Point beam
- Cannot target air units (ground only)
