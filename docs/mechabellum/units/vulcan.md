# Vulcan

## Overview

The Vulcan is one of the strongest units in Mechabellum, excelling at eating mobs with its devastating flamethrower attacks. This giant unit sprays flames over a wide area, making it the natural enemy of all lightly armed units. None of the mob units (except Wasps) have a valid response to Vulcans.

The Vulcan has good synergy with high-damage-per-shot units like Marksmen because Vulcans easily clear chaff units that would otherwise interfere with single-target damage dealers.

- 74 damage per tick = 740 base DPS per target
- Cone hits multiple targets simultaneously
- Against swarms, total damage output multiplies dramatically

- Attacks ignite targets, causing burn damage over time
- Ignited units lose 6% HP per second for 2 seconds
- Ignite ticks at 1.2% HP every 0.2 seconds
- Stacks with direct flame damage for devastating sustained damage

**Incendiary Bomb (Tech):**
- Launches barrage every 16 seconds
- Creates lingering fire zones on impact
- Range: 40m minimum, 180m maximum

### Tech Analysis

**Scorching Flames** - Used against medium units like Sledgehammers and Steel Balls. Sometimes needed against leveled Crawlers. Good vs Armor tech and can even kill giants with leveled Vulcans.

**Range Enhancement** - Very strong as it allows Vulcan to clear everything faster without walking into danger. Risky tech because Vulcan can get stuck on Barriers and Giants. Best to have Melting Point with range before teching Vulcan range.

**Armor Enhancement** - Not a priority tech but valuable in long-range games where Vulcans serve as frontline tanks, taking damage from multiple sources.

**Sticky Oil Bomb** - Cheaper version of Incendiary Bomb. Pair with Incendiary to set everything on fire.

**Incendiary Bomb** - Primarily used to destroy Melting Points and Stormcallers. Combine with EMP-based units to ensure enemies rarely escape the burning ground.

**Best Partner** - Excellent against Wraith pushes when you summon Aerial Spec Marksmen. Works well with Senior Manufacturing specialist when building ~4 Vulcans.

**Ignite** - Situationally good against War Factories. Consider if you frequently face War Factory strategies.

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Curb Mob Spam** - If the enemy is spamming mobs, Vulcan is your answer.

2. **Pair with Marksmen** - Vulcan clears chaff, Marksmen snipe high-value targets. Excellent synergy.

3. **Incendiary vs Melting Point** - Use Incendiary Bomb to destroy Melting Points and Stormcallers that threaten your composition.

### Defensive Use

1. **Frontline Tank** - In long-range games, Vulcans can serve as your main frontline, absorbing damage from multiple sources.

2. **Protect from Air** - Always have anti-air coverage. Vulcans have no way to deal with air units.

3. **Counter Crawlers** - Position Vulcans where enemy Crawlers will funnel into flame range.

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Chaff Clear:**
1. Scorching Flames (if facing medium units)
2. Range Enhancement (once you have Melting Point range)
3. Incendiary Bomb (vs specific threats)

**Anti-Melting Point:**
1. Incendiary Bomb
2. Sticky Oil Bomb (combo with fire)
3. Range Enhancement

**Wraith Counter Build:**
1. Best Partner (summon Aerial Spec Marksmen)
2. Scorching Flames

### Efficiency Ranking (Chaff Clear)

**Early Game:** Vulcan > Arclight > Sledgehammer

**Mid/Late Game:** Vulcan > Sledgehammer > Stormcaller > Mustang > Arclight

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |

| **Scorpion** | Excellent | Both benefit from clear lanes |
