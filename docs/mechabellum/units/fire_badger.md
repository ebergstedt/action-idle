# Fire Badger (Rare)

## Overview

The Fire Badger is classified as a Medium Anti-Swarm Tank. This rare unit can only be obtained from free unit packs and is one of the four Rare units in Mechabellum, making it highly exclusive. Fire Badgers are some of the strongest close-range units in the game - cheap to recruit and capable of decimating chaff units.

The role of Fire Badger is not to be a "carry unit," but to burn away enemy chaff and let other units roam free. With damage and range upgrades, they can also threaten medium units. Use Fire Badgers similarly to Sledgehammers - as a frontline tank that clears all the chaff along the way.

### Weapon Mechanics

**Attack Type:** Continuous flamethrower (AOE)

**Flamethrower Mechanics:**

- **Splash Range:** 7m - flame hits all enemies in the area
- **Short Range:** 75m is much shorter than similar units like Vulcan
- **Rotation Speed:** 80 degrees/second
- **Fire DOT:** Base attacks can apply fire damage over time with Ignite tech

**DPS Breakdown:**
- Damage per tick: 25
- Ticks per second: 10
- Base DPS per unit: 250
- Full squad DPS: 750
- Effective DPS vs clustered chaff is much higher due to cone hitting multiple targets

**HP Comparison:**
- Fire Badger: 4,222 HP per unit
- Arclight: ~4,500 HP per unit
- Fire Badger has slightly less HP but comes in squads of 3

**Fire/Burn Mechanics:**
- **Ignite Tech:** Chance to ignite targets for 6% HP/second for 2 seconds
- **Liquid Fire (Scorching Ground):** Creates 15m radius fire zone lasting 20 seconds, dealing 350 DPS
- **Napalm Tech (Alternative):** Creates 12m radius fire zone lasting 8 seconds, dealing 270 DPS (reduces HP by 30%)
- **Friendly Fire Warning:** Allied units are vulnerable to ground fire

**Recent Balance Changes (2025):**
- Made core unit in Season 5 (was previously Rare)
- Movement speed and range increased from original
- HP decreased from original
- **Scorching Fire:** ATK modifier changed from +100% to +85%
- **Counter-Fire:** +50% HP, taking damage increases Range by 70 for 20s
- **Scorching Charge:** +90% HP, charges and detonates at <50% HP

*Stats current as of Season 5 (2025). Values may change with balance patches.*

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Ignite** | 200 | Attacks ignite the target. Ignited units lose 6% HP per second for 2s. |
| **Liquid Fire** | 200 | Attack ignites the ground within 15m of target. Ground fires last for 20s and cause 350 damage per second. |
| **Scorching Fire** | 250 | Increases Fire Badgers' ATK by 125%. |
| **Field Maintenance** | 300 | Increases HP by 30%, automatically restores 4.5% Max HP per second upon taking damage. |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Increases attack range by 40m. |

### Tech Analysis

**Liquid Fire (Scorching Ground)** - Very strong against leveled, Subterranean Blitz Crawlers especially. The ground fire persists for 20 seconds, creating dangerous zones that damage anything passing through.

**Field Maintenance** - Very strong technology for Fire Badgers serving as frontline tanks. The HP increase and regeneration significantly improve survivability. Counter-Fire and Scorching Charge technologies can also enhance survivability while providing utility when range is not needed.

**Range Enhancement** - Probably good vs Fangs and Mustangs since Fire Badger's base range is quite low. Helps Fire Badgers engage before taking damage.

**Scorching Fire** - Pure damage increase (125% ATK). Good for threatening medium units beyond just chaff clearing.

**Ignite** - Very niche tech that can allow Fire Badgers to cripple high-HP units. However, the recommendation is to never tech Ignite - Fire Badgers have such short range they either don't connect, or require more investment to do the same job another unit does 10x better.

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Frontline Tank** - Use Fire Badgers like Sledgehammers. They serve as your frontline tank for damage units and clear all chaff along the way.

2. **Anti-Crawler Specialist** - Fire Badgers are very strong against Crawlers, demolishing them without requiring any technologies.

3. **Zone Control** - With Liquid Fire tech, create persistent fire zones that deny areas and damage anything passing through.

### Defensive Use

1. **Chaff Protection** - Position Fire Badgers to intercept enemy Crawlers and Fangs before they reach your valuable units.

2. **Frontline Sustain** - With Field Maintenance, Fire Badgers can sustain as frontline tanks while your damage dealers work.

### Tech Build Paths

**Frontline Tank Build:**
1. Field Maintenance
2. Range Enhancement (if needed)

**Anti-Crawler Build:**
1. Liquid Fire (Scorching Ground)

**Damage Build:**
1. Scorching Fire
2. Range Enhancement

### General Advice

- When you see Fire Badgers, build Fangs as chaff instead of Crawlers since Fire Badgers have short range.
- In midgame, use armored Sledgehammers to tank the damage or go straight into Fortresses.
- If your opponent predicts your strategy and fields Wasps or Phoenixes early on, they can easily dismantle Fire Badgers.
- Fire Badgers are a rare unit - you cannot reliably build strategies around them since they're only available from unit packs.
- The short range is the main weakness - Fire Badgers either don't connect or require support to reach targets.

## Synergies

|------|---------|-------|
| **Mustang** | Excellent | Fire Badgers tank while Mustangs deal damage and provide anti-air |
