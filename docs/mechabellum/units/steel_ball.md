# Steel Ball

## Overview

The Steel Ball is a fast-moving, short-ranged unit that functions as a mini-Melting Point. Its main attack is a laser beam that progressively gets stronger as the unit attacks, designed to rapidly shred high-HP units. Unlike Melting Points, Steel Balls are extremely fast - some of the fastest units in the game.

Steel Balls excel against high-HP units with either low range or low fire rate, particularly as a reactionary unit against Rhinos, shields, and deployable barriers. They are best deployed near your base to intercept enemy pushes.

### Weapon Mechanics - Laser Beam Ramping System

**Attack Type:** Continuous laser beam with progressive damage scaling

The Steel Ball's signature mechanic is its ramping laser damage. Unlike other units with flat damage, the beam starts weak and grows stronger the longer it fires at a target.

**Base Stats:**
- **Base Damage:** 55 per tick (displayed stat; effective damage ramps from 2 to 2,605)
- **Attack Interval:** 0.2 seconds (5 ticks per second)
- **Base DPS:** 275 (at minimum ramp)

**Damage Ramp-Up:**
- **Initial Damage:** Starts at 2 damage per tick
- **Maximum Damage:** Ramps to 2,605 damage per tick
- **Ramp Time:** Takes approximately 4 seconds to reach first max DPS tick
- **Subsequent Ramps:** After reaching max, takes ~2 seconds between max damage ticks
- **Time to 1M Damage:** A full squad needs ~26 seconds to deal 1,000,000 total damage

**Beam Mechanics:**
- **Attack Interval:** 0.2 seconds (5 ticks per second)
- **Target Lock:** Beam stays connected while target is in range
- **Splash Range:** 0 (single-target only)
- **Ramp Reset:** Damage resets to minimum if:
  - Target dies
  - Target moves out of range
  - Steel Ball is forced to switch targets (chaff distraction)
  - Steel Ball is disabled by EMP

**Effective DPS Curve:**
- First 4 seconds: Low DPS (~500-2,000 per unit)
- After 4 seconds: Rapidly escalating DPS
- Sustained engagement: Maximum DPS of ~13,025 per unit

**Strategic Implications:**
- Excels against slow, high-HP targets that allow sustained beam contact
- Vulnerable to chaff that forces target switching and resets ramp
- Short range (45m) requires closing distance before damage begins

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Fortified Target Lock** | 200 | When switching targets, lock-on priority is given to the unit with the highest HP in range. |
| **Energy Absorption** | 250 | Increases HP by 40% and converts damage dealt to HP (lifesteal). |
| **Damage Sharing** | 250 | Chains adjacent Steel Balls together, increasing HP by 120% and sharing damage received equally between them. |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Increases attack range by 40m. |
| **Mechanical Division** | 350 | Destroyed Steel Balls create 5 level 1 Crawlers to continue fighting. |
| **Armor Enhancement** | 350 | HP +35% and 60 damage blocked (+60/rank). |

### Tech Analysis

**Energy Absorption** - Often the first tech when pushing with Steel Balls and beaconing to enemy towers. The lifesteal helps them stay alive while connecting to targets.

**Damage Sharing** - Chains your Steel Balls together, distributing damage equally between them. Greatly increases the unit's total HP (120% boost). This makes Steel Balls much more resilient to high-burst units.

**Range Enhancement** - Always the first choice when building Steel Balls as a reactionary unit against Giants. Extra range means safer positioning.

**Mechanical Division** - A must-have tech. Having it available forces the opponent to prepare for it, and if they don't, it can win you the game. The spawned Crawlers continue fighting after Steel Balls die.

**Armor Enhancement** - Good against Mustangs. The damage reduction stacks with unit levels.

**Heavy Target** - Sounds good on paper (prioritize highest HP targets), but in real games it rarely works out as intended. Generally not recommended.

## Counters

### What Beats Steel Balls

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Wasp** | Hard Counter | A single Wasp unit can disrupt your entire formation |
| **Phoenix** | Hard Counter | Air units are the bane of Steel Balls |
| **Overlord** | Hard Counter | Massive air threat Steel Balls cannot target |
| **Crawler** | Good Counter | Chaff units draw fire away from important targets |
| **Hacker** | Good Counter | Can hack Steel Balls easily |
| **Stormcaller** | Good Counter | Long-range AOE, especially when defenders group up |
| **Scorpion** | Good Counter | High single-target damage from range |

### What Steel Balls Beat

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Fortress** | Hard Counter | Laser damage shreds through high HP |
| **Rhino** | Hard Counter | Excellent against Rhino pushes |
| **Melting Point** | Hard Counter | Can kill before Melting Point ramps up |
| **Vulcan** | Hard Counter | High HP units fall to ramping laser |
| **War Factory** | Good Counter | Same principle - high HP gets shredded |
| **Fire Badger** | Good Counter | Short range lets Steel Balls connect |
| **Typhoon** | Good Counter | High HP, low fire rate - ideal target |
| **Barriers/Shields** | Good Counter | Lasers eat through deployable barriers |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Push with Beacon** - When beaconing Steel Balls to enemy towers, Energy Absorption should often be your first tech to sustain while dealing damage.

2. **Pair with Mustangs** - Steel Balls and Mustangs share the same movement speed (16 m/s) and cover each other's weaknesses perfectly. Mustangs handle air and chaff while Steel Balls kill giants.

3. **Defend Against Defending** - Steel Balls pushing can be distracted. Deploy Fangs vertically in front of your tower so all enemy balls gather around, then blast them with 2 packs of Stormcallers.

### Defensive Use

1. **Reactionary Deployment** - Steel Balls shine as a reactionary unit vs Rhinos and shields/deployable barriers, especially when deployed near your base.

2. **Counter Giants** - When you see enemy giants, Steel Balls with Range Enhancement punish them hard.

### Tech Build Paths

**Reactionary/Anti-Giant Build:**
1. Range Enhancement
2. Mechanical Division

**Push Build:**
1. Energy Absorption
2. Damage Sharing or Mechanical Division

**Anti-Mustang Build:**
1. Armor Enhancement
2. Damage Sharing

### General Advice

- Always have anti-air support when running Steel Balls. A single unit of Wasps can disrupt your entire formation.
- Mechanical Division creates a lose-lose for opponents: either prepare for Crawlers or watch them overwhelm after Steel Balls die.
- Steel Balls are often paired with Wraiths that are strong against Crawlers. If this is not the case, overwhelming them with Crawlers is an easy option.

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Mustang** | Excellent | Same movement speed, cover each other's weaknesses |
| **Wraith** | Excellent | Wraith handles Crawlers that distract Steel Balls |
| **Fang** | Good | Provides anti-air support |
| **Stormcaller** | Good | Clears chaff threats |

## Strengths

- One of the fastest units in the game (16 m/s)
- Ramping laser damage shreds high-HP targets
- Excellent against giants and barriers
- Good synergy with Mustangs
- Mechanical Division creates powerful fallback option
- Strong reactionary unit when positioned defensively

## Weaknesses

- Cannot target air units at all
- Vulnerable to all air units, especially Wasps
- Weak to chaff units that draw fire
- Damage needs time to ramp up (4+ seconds to reach max DPS)
- Short base range requires closing distance
