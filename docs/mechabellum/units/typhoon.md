# Typhoon

## Overview

The Typhoon is essentially a slower but more durable version of the Mustang. This tanky anti-air platform features rapid-fire attacks with splash damage, making it excellent at shredding light units and air units. Combined with its barrier ability, the Typhoon excels in aggressive frontline roles.

The Typhoon is a **Rare unit** that can only be obtained through Random Reinforcement cards between rounds or by special starting specialists - it cannot be unlocked directly during a match. Unlike standard units, Rare units have a limited selection of techs that are always available.

## Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Cost** | 300 Supply |
| **Unlock Cost** | Rare (Random Reinforcement only) |
| **Unit Count** | 2 per squad |
| **Unit HP** | 9,529 (per unit) |
| **Squad HP** | 19,058 (total) |
| **Attack Damage** | 88 per hit |
| **Attack Interval** | 0.2s (5 hits/second) |
| **DPS** | 440 per unit (880 squad) |
| **Range** | 100m |
| **Splash Radius** | Small AOE per hit |
| **Speed** | 9 m/s |
| **Target** | Ground and Air |

### Weapon Mechanics

**Dual Gatling Cannons:**
- Each Typhoon mounts twin rapid-fire gatling guns
- Fires every 0.2 seconds (5 rounds per second)
- Each hit deals 88 damage with small splash radius
- Sustained fire shreds swarms and light units quickly

**Splash Damage:**
- Small AOE on each hit allows hitting clustered enemies
- Effective against tightly grouped Crawlers and Fangs
- Splash helps clear chaff faster than single-target weapons

**Barrier Shield (Tech):**
- Generates large protective shield for allies within
- Shield HP: 11,000 per unit level
- Two Typhoons provide double barrier coverage (22,000+ HP total)
- Deploy vertically for maximum shield overlap

**Homing Missiles (Tech):**
- Launches 4 homing missiles every 8 seconds
- Each missile deals 675 damage (+450 per level)
- Range: 60m minimum, 180m maximum
- Provides burst damage against medium units

*Note: Stats may vary based on game version and balance patches.*

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Mechanical Rage** | 300 | Movement speed +4, ATK +50%. Great for aggressive plays. |
| **Aerial Specialization** | 300 | ATK +90% vs aerial units, Range +30 when attacking air. |
| **Barrier** | 300 | Generates large-scale shield protecting allies within it. Shield HP increases by 11,000 per unit level. |
| **Homing Missiles** | 300 | Launches 4 homing missiles every 8s. Each deals 675 damage (+450 per level). Max range 180m, min range 60m. |

### Tech Analysis

**Barrier** - Generally the first tech choice unless facing Steel Balls or giants. Creates a protective shield for allies. Since there are 2 units in the pack, the total barrier strength is doubled. Deploy Typhoons vertically to maximize barrier coverage.

**Homing Missiles** - Provides significant additional damage, especially against medium-unit-heavy boards (Steel Balls, Sledgehammers). The 180m range even allows tower sniping.

**Mechanical Rage** - Excellent for what Typhoon does best - aggressive plays. Both movement speed and damage increases are valuable, but Barrier or Homing Missiles often take priority.

**Aerial Specialization** - Situationally strong against Wasps specifically. Phoenix outrange Typhoons, and Wraiths/Overlords are usually too tanky to kill efficiently with this tech alone.

## Counters

### What Beats Typhoon

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Steel Ball** | Hard Counter | Good vs Typhoon's barrier, protects Crawlers behind |
| **Fortress** | Hard Counter | Outranges and outguns Typhoons |
| **Scorpion** | Hard Counter | High single-target damage destroys Typhoons |
| **Medium Units** | Good Counter | Sledgehammers, heavy units block Typhoon damage |

### What Typhoon Beats

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Crawler** | Hard Counter | Rapid-fire AOE devastates swarms |
| **Fang** | Hard Counter | Shreds light melee units |
| **Wasp** | Strong Counter | With Aerial Spec, excellent anti-Wasp |
| **Light Units** | Strong Counter | General chaff clear capability |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Aggressive Frontline** - Due to short range, Typhoon works best as part of aggressive strategies or defending against aggression.

2. **Vertical Deployment** - Place Typhoons vertically (stacked) to get better coverage from the dual barriers.

3. **Complement Aggression** - Pair with units that benefit from the barrier protection during aggressive pushes.

### Defensive Use

1. **Anti-Aggro Defense** - Excellent at stopping aggressive pushes with chaff and air units.

2. **Barrier Protection** - Use Barrier to protect more valuable units behind the shield.

3. **Anti-Air Coverage** - Aerial Spec tech specifically counters Wasp plays.

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Build:**
1. Barrier (first for protection)
2. Homing Missiles (damage against medium units)
3. Mechanical Rage (if needed)

**Anti-Air Build:**
1. Aerial Specialization
2. Barrier

**All-In Aggressive:**
1. Mechanical Rage
2. Barrier
3. Homing Missiles

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Aggressive Units** | Excellent | Barrier protects push compositions |
| **Giants** | Good | Barrier can shield giants from initial damage |
| **Medium Units** | Good | Homing Missiles complement medium-unit boards |

## Strengths

- Tanky for a chaff-clear unit
- Dual barrier from 2-unit squad provides excellent protection
- Strong anti-light and anti-air capability
- Good defensive tool against aggressive plays
- Homing Missiles provide long-range damage option
- All techs are solid choices

## Weaknesses

- Relatively short range (100m)
- No Range Enhancement tech available
- Slower than Mustang (9 m/s vs 16 m/s)
- Rare unit - cannot be reliably obtained
- Countered by Steel Balls and heavy units
- Best used aggressively but needs frontline positioning
