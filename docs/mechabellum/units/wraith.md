# Wraith

## Overview

The Wraith is a tanky aerial unit that serves as a mothership for floating cannons. In early game, it provides solid chaff clear. With levels and technologies, it can become the fastest chaff clearer in the game and a fearsome DPS threat.

Unlike other chaff clear units, the Wraith always targets up to 4 different units as long as enough targets are in range. This prevents it from getting stuck on a single tank like a Rhino, making it perfect for efficiently cleaning up Crawlers and exposing short-ranged units hiding behind them.

### Multi-Target Beam Mechanics

**Floating Cannons:**
- Wraith itself mounts no weapons, serves as mothership
- 4 floating cannons orbit and fire independently
- Each cannon targets a different enemy if available
- Always hits up to 4 separate targets simultaneously
- Cannot be body-blocked by tanks like Rhino

**Attack Pattern:**
- Each cannon deals 381 damage every 1.6 seconds
- 8m splash radius per beam hit
- Total squad DPS: ~952 across 4 targets
- Perfect for clearing Crawlers without getting stuck

**Floating Artillery Array (Tech):**
- Increases cannons from 4 to 8
- Movement speed reduced by 3 m/s
- Effectively doubles damage output
- Stacks multiplicatively with damage items
- Cost: 400 supply

**Degeneration Beam (Tech):**
- Projects debuff aura to ground units within 120m
- Affected enemies: Movement speed -40%
- Affected enemies: ATK -20% (some sources say -30%)
- Affected enemies: Damage taken +30%
- Temporarily blocked by Photon Coating/Emission

**Range Enhancement:**
- Base range: 60m (notably short)
- With Range Enhancement: 100m
- Almost mandatory first tech for safety

*Note: Stats may vary based on game version and balance patches.*

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **High-Explosive Ammo** | 150 | Splash damage range of the floating cannon +5m, ATK -40%. |
| **Field Maintenance** | 200 | HP +30%, restores 4.5% Max HP/sec when taking damage. |
| **Armor Enhancement** | 200 | HP +35% and 60 damage blocked (+60/rank). |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Attack range +40m. |
| **Degenerate Beam** | 200 | Projects debuff beam to enemy units within 120m. Reduces movement speed by 40%, ATK by 30%, and increases damage taken by 30%. |
| **Floating Artillery Array** | 400 | Increases floating cannons from 4 to 8. |

### Tech Analysis

**Range Enhancement** - Almost mandatory as the first tech. Allows faster chaff clear and protects Wraith by keeping it further back. Essential for the unit.

**Degeneration Beam** - The signature Wraith technology. Applies significant debuffs to all nearby ground units - 40% slow, 30% ATK reduction, and 30% extra damage taken. Temporarily blocked by Photon Coating/Emission.

**Floating Artillery Array** - Expensive but doubles damage output. Better than +100% damage because it stacks with items and hits multiple targets. Very worthwhile if you have multiple Wraiths.

**Field Maintenance** - Generally better than Armor Enhancement since it's stronger with high-level Wraiths from free unit drops. The 30% HP + regen provides excellent sustain.

**Armor Enhancement** - Cheap at 200 cost. Good with Mass Produced Wraith card especially. Effective against Mustangs.

**High-Explosive Ammo** - Situational splash increase but the 40% damage reduction hurts.

## Counters

### What Beats Wraith

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Phoenix** | Hard Counter | Outranges Wraith significantly |
| **Farseer (EMP)** | Hard Counter | EMP disables Wraith techs |
| **Mustang (Aerial Spec)** | Strong Counter | Fast anti-air pressure |
| **Marksman (Aerial Spec)** | Strong Counter | Long-range anti-air |
| **Overlord** | Good Counter | Air-to-air combat |
| **Fortress (Anti-Air)** | Good Counter | Anti-Air Barrage threatens Wraith |

### What Wraith Beats

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Crawler** | Hard Counter | Multi-target beams clear swarms, can't be body-blocked |
| **Fang** | Hard Counter | Same as Crawlers |
| **Light Units** | Hard Counter | General chaff clear capability |
| **Ground-Only Units** | Strong Counter | Air unit, immune to ground attacks |
| **Rhino** | Good Counter | Multi-target prevents getting stuck on tank |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Anti-Crawler Specialist** - Wraith's damage cannot be blocked by other units. It always targets 4 different units, making it perfect for clearing Crawlers efficiently.

2. **Expose Backline** - Clear the chaff to expose short-ranged units hiding behind swarms.

3. **Multi-Flank Defense** - Best used as anti-aggro when enemy pushes from multiple sides.

### Defensive Use

1. **Protect from Anti-Air** - Wraith's short range requires careful positioning. Protect it or it will quickly fall to enemy anti-air.

2. **Degeneration Support** - Position Wraith to apply Degeneration Beam debuffs to enemy ground forces, supporting your entire army.

3. **Sustain Build** - With Field Maintenance and/or Armor Enhancement, Wraith becomes nearly unkillable if opponent lacks significant anti-air DPS.

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Chaff Clear:**
1. Range Enhancement (first for safety)
2. Floating Artillery Array (double damage)
3. Degeneration Beam (team support)

**Tank Build:**
1. Range Enhancement
2. Field Maintenance
3. Armor Enhancement

**Support Debuff Build:**
1. Range Enhancement
2. Degeneration Beam
3. Field Maintenance

### Important Notes

- Due to short range, Wraith requires careful positioning and protection
- In some cases, Wraith ratings are lowered when it can't defeat ground units before destroying the HQ starting from its own base - this reflects its chaff clear role
- Photon Coating/Emission temporarily blocks Degeneration Beam

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Sandworm** | Excellent | Often paired for aggressive strategies |
| **Crawler** | Good | Crawlers absorb fire while Wraith clears |
| **Steel Ball** | Good | Aggressive combinations |
| **Ground Army** | Good | Degeneration Beam supports entire team |

## Strengths

- Best chaff clear against Crawlers (cannot be body-blocked)
- Multi-target beams always hit 4 different units
- Air unit - safe from ground-only attacks
- Degeneration Beam provides powerful team-wide debuffs
- Can become nearly unkillable with sustain techs
- Floating Artillery Array doubles damage output
- Exposes backline by clearing frontline chaff

## Weaknesses

- Short base range (60m) requires protection
- Vulnerable to Phoenix which outranges it
- EMP disables critical techs
- Easily targeted by anti-air units
- Degeneration Beam blocked by Photon effects
- Requires tech investment for full effectiveness
- Not designed for tower racing from own base
- Not a giant unit (Tier 3, 300 supply)
