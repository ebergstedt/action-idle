# Sandworm

## Overview

The Sandworm is a formidable giant melee unit that specializes in burrowing underground. This allows it to approach enemies without taking damage while beneath the surface, making it one of the most unique units in Mechabellum.

The Sandworm excels at protecting Wasps with its Sandstorm ability, disrupting enemy formations, and creating chaos with its Larvae spawning technologies. It can be teched to deal with many different board states - you can use a few and level them, or go wide with mass Sandworms and summoning techs.

### Burrow Mechanics

**Underground Movement:**
- Burrows underground when moving, completely invisible
- Immune to all damage while burrowed
- Emerges to attack enemies, then can re-burrow
- Bypasses frontline to strike backline units directly

**Burrow Regeneration (Tech: Underground Maintenance):**
- Recovers 15% Max HP per second while burrowed
- Incredible sustain against ranged compositions
- Can repeatedly burrow/emerge to heal between engagements
- Not effective against beam weapons that track through ground

**Emergence Attack:**
- Emerges with high-damage melee strike
- Wide splash radius hits multiple nearby enemies
- 4,800 damage per attack with 2.0s interval
- Excellent against grouped medium units

**Sandstorm (Tech):**
- Creates 120m radius sandstorm on emergence
- Lasts 10 seconds
- Enemies in sandstorm: Range reduced by 50%
- Enemies in sandstorm: Ranged damage reduced by 30%
- Protects Wasps from Mustangs and Fortress Anti-Air

**Larva Spawning:**
- Mechanical Division: Spawns 4 Larvae on Sandworm death
- Replicate: Creates 1 Larva each time Sandworm emerges
- Larvae have ~1/9 HP and ~1/6 DPS of parent Sandworm
- Creates swarm chaos across battlefield

*Note: Stats may vary based on game version and balance patches.*

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Mechanical Rage** | 250 | Movement speed +4, attack interval -0.8s. |
| **Armor Enhancement** | 200 | HP +35% and 60 damage blocked (+60/level). |
| **Mechanical Division** | 250 | Spawns four level 1 Larvae when Sandworm is destroyed. |
| **Anti-Air** | 250 | Enables Sandworm to attack aerial targets. |
| **Underground Maintenance** | 250 | Recovers 15% Max HP per second while burrowed. |
| **Replicate** | 250 | Creates one Larva each time Sandworm emerges from ground. |
| **Sandstorm** | 250 | When emerging, creates 120m radius sandstorm lasting 10s. Units inside have range -50% and ranged damage -30%. |

### Tech Analysis

**Sandstorm** - The signature tech for aggressive Sandworm plays. Reduces all ranged attack damage by 30% and halves enemy range, making it excellent for protecting Wasps from Mustangs and Fortress Anti-Air.

**Mechanical Division** - Very strong with multiple Sandworms against beam weapons. Excellent vs Wraiths especially. Spawning 4 Larvae on death provides significant value.

**Underground Maintenance** - Recovers 15% HP per second while burrowed. Incredible against Overlords and air units that the Sandworm isn't targeting. Not good against beam weapons.

**Replicate** - Creates a Larva each time Sandworm emerges. Strong in chaotic fights across the battlefield. Protects the initial Sandworm from dying compared to Mechanical Division.

**Anti-Air** - Allows massing Sandworms against Overlord responses. Note: Not always needed since Sandworms can burrow away from air units and target the tower instead.

**Mechanical Rage** - Both movement speed and faster attack are valuable, but survival and summoning techs are usually better investments.

**Armor Enhancement** - Primarily used against long-range heavy units like Extended-Range Mountain. Less effective against Vulcan with Ignite tech.

## Counters

### What Beats Sandworm

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **War Factory** | Hard Counter | Absolutely demolishes Sandworms |
| **Fortress (Launcher Overload)** | Hard Counter | Strong option with fast attack speed |
| **Steel Ball** | Strong Counter | Can block and distract Sandworms |
| **Melting Point** | Strong Counter | Beam follows even burrowing Sandworm |
| **Overlord (Artillery)** | Strong Counter | Ground cannons deal with Sandworms |
| **Scorpion (Acid)** | Good Counter | Acid works since worms can't get Photon while burrowed |
| **Phoenix (Charged Shot)** | Good Counter | Usually enough damage to kill Sandworm |

### What Sandworm Beats

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Backline Units** | Hard Counter | Burrows past frontline to hit artillery |
| **Wasp Counters** | Strong Counter | Sandstorm protects Wasps from Mustangs/Fortress AA |
| **Ranged Units** | Strong Counter | Sandstorm reduces range and damage |
| **Overlord (no Artillery)** | Good Counter | Can burrow and regen, then tower dive |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Protect Wasps** - The best use case for Sandworm is protecting Wasps with Sandstorm against Mustangs and Fortress Anti-Air.

2. **Tower Dive** - Sandworms can burrow past the enemy army and hit the tower directly. Use Underground Maintenance to heal while burrowed.

3. **Chaos Creation** - Mass Sandworms with Replicate/Mechanical Division to create endless Larvae chaos across the battlefield.

### Defensive Use

1. **Anti-Ranged** - Sandstorm reduces ranged damage by 30% and range by 50%, protecting your entire army.

2. **Flexible Response** - Sandworm can be teched to deal with many board states. Adapt your tech choices to the matchup.

3. **Anti-Air Coverage** - If enemy responds with Overlords, tech Anti-Air to mass Sandworms as counters.

### Tech Build Paths

**Aggressive Wasp Support:**
1. Sandstorm (protect Wasps)
2. Replicate (ongoing Larvae)
3. Mechanical Division (death Larvae)

**Tower Dive Build:**
1. Underground Maintenance (heal while burrowed)
2. Armor Enhancement (survive longer)
3. Anti-Air (if needed)

**Anti-Beam Build:**
1. Mechanical Division (Larvae vs Wraith/MP beams)
2. Armor Enhancement
3. Underground Maintenance

**Mass Sandworm Build:**
1. No levels, go wide
2. Replicate or Mechanical Division
3. Sandstorm for team protection

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Wasp** | Excellent | Sandstorm protects Wasps from anti-air |
| **Wraith** | Good | Often paired for aggressive strategies |
| **Crawler** | Good | Crawlers provide additional swarm pressure |
| **Steel Ball** | Good | Aggressive combinations together |

## Strengths

- Fastest giant unit (11 m/s)
- Burrows underground, immune to damage while burrowed
- Sandstorm provides massive team protection
- Larvae spawning creates overwhelming numbers
- Underground Maintenance provides incredible sustain vs air
- Can tower dive past enemy army
- Flexible tech tree handles many situations

## Weaknesses

- Ground-only attacks without Anti-Air tech
- Melee range requires closing distance
- Hard countered by War Factory
- Beam weapons track even while burrowed
- Acid attacks work since burrowed worms can't receive Photon
- Requires good positioning and timing
- Larvae are weak individually
