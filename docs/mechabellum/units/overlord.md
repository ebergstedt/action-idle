- Combined: Effectively doubles DPS with minimal range loss
- Standard carry build for maximum damage output

**Mothership (Tech):**

### Tech Analysis

**Overlord Artillery** - "Unlocks" the massive cannons at the prow. Ground-only but deals massive damage with amazing AOE. Essential for carry Overlord builds.

**Launcher Overload** - Increases attack rate at the cost of range. Always pair with Range Enhancement to create true carry Overlords.

**Range Enhancement** - Almost always needed. Range alone is a bit useless, so pair it with Launcher Overload for the standard carry build.

**Field Maintenance** - Regenerates health while taking damage. Combined with the +30% HP, provides excellent sustain.

**Armor Enhancement** - Standard defensive option. The flat damage reduction scales well with levels.

**Photon Emission** - Powerful team-wide protection. Reduces damage and grants immunity to debuffs for 20 seconds.

**Mothership** - Produces 4 Wasps every 30 seconds. The Wasps' damage is negligible but they're excellent for tanking Phoenix/Marksmen shots and forcing enemies into Mustangs.

**Jump Drive** - Mobility upgrade with repositioning during deployment. Good for aggressive positioning.

**High-Explosive Ammo** - Cheap splash increase but 40% damage reduction. Situational.

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Carry Build** - The standard carry setup is Range + Launcher Overload. This creates devastating DPS output.

2. **Tower Pressure** - Overlord puts massive pressure on enemy tower. Use as aggressive unit, not standard long-range play.

3. **Mothership Tanking** - Use Mothership to produce Wasps that tank Phoenix/Marksmen shots, forcing enemies into Mustangs.

### Defensive Use

1. **Backline Positioning** - Overlord is a backline damage dealer. Protect with Rhinos, Steel Balls, or Sledgehammers.

2. **Photon Support** - Photon Emission protects your entire ground army from debuffs and reduces damage.

3. **Protect from Mustangs** - Always watch for Aerial Spec Mustangs. One squad can destroy your Overlord investment.

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Carry Build:**
1. Range Enhancement (first for safety)
2. Launcher Overload (combine for high DPS)
3. Overlord Artillery (ground damage boost)

**Tank Support Build:**
1. Field Maintenance
2. Armor Enhancement
3. Photon Emission

**Wasp Factory Build:**
1. Mothership (tank enemy anti-air)
2. Range Enhancement
