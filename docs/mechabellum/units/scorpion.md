# Scorpion

## Overview

The Scorpion is a durable, high-damage specialist designed to dismantle medium units and barriers while punishing overcommitted strategies. This spider tank features massive single-target damage with a slow reload time, making it a reactive powerhouse against specific threats.

Scorpions excel at melting Steel Balls, Sledgehammers, and War Factory turrets. With the Acid Attack tech, they become one of the most devastating anti-giant units in the game. However, their reliance on chaff support and vulnerability to swarms demand careful deployment.

## Stats

### Weapon Mechanics

**Artillery Cannon:**
- Fires a single high-damage shell with a 4.5s reload time
- Shell has travel time, can miss fast-moving targets
- Massive single-target damage designed to one-shot medium units
- Deals approximately 10,650 damage per shot at base level

**Splash Mechanics:**
- Base attack has 8m splash radius (increased from 3m in patch 0.7.40)
- Acid Attack tech creates 15m radius acid pool at impact point
- Acid pool persists for 40 seconds
- Units in acid lose 3% HP/sec and take 250% damage from all sources

**Range Tech Stacking:**
- Base range: 100m
- Range Enhancement: +40m (total 140m)
- Siege Mode: +70m (total 170m, or 210m with Range Enhancement)
- Maximum achievable: 277m (with Laser Sight equipment + range card)

*Note: Stats may vary based on game version and balance patches.*

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Armor Enhancement** | 200 | HP increased by 35% and 60 damage blocked when attacked. Blocking increases by 60 per level. |
| **Field Maintenance** | 300 | Automatically restores 4.5% Max HP per second upon taking damage. |
| **Doubleshot** | 300 | Each attack fires 2 shells in succession but increases reload time by 12%. |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Increases attack range by 40m. |
| **Siege Mode** | 300 | Range +70m, ATK -35%, cannot attack within 75m, attack interval +1.5s. |
| **Acid Attack** | 300 | Creates acid area (15m radius) at hit point. Lasts 40s. Units in acid lose 3% HP/sec and take 250% damage. |

### Tech Analysis

**Armor Enhancement** - Solid defensive option that lets Scorpion tank more damage. The flat damage reduction scales well with levels and helps against rapid-fire units.

**Field Maintenance** - Previously the best tech before HP buff removal. Still good if you have leveled Scorpions and want to force the enemy into Melting Points.

**Doubleshot** - Makes Scorpion an independent giant killer. Combined with Acid Attack, the first shot creates acid, and the second shot deals staggering damage. Do NOT combine with Siege Mode as the attack interval becomes painfully long (7.2s).

**Range Enhancement** - Almost always needed eventually. Don't tech too early as it makes you vulnerable to Overlord switch. Better to use Scorpion as frontline tank in early game.

**Siege Mode** - Transforms Scorpion into long-range artillery. Great for late-game ranged compositions but removes close-range flexibility.

**Acid Attack** - Very strong late game tech. If you've survived to have a stable board with ranged Scorpions, acid attack becomes devastating against giants and War Factories.

## Counters

### What Beats Scorpion

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Phoenix** | Hard Counter | Air unit, Scorpion cannot retaliate |
| **Overlord** | Hard Counter | Air unit with massive damage |
| **Wasps** | Hard Counter | Air swarm, especially effective early |
| **Crawlers** | Strong Counter | Swarms overwhelm single-target damage |
| **Melting Point** | Good Counter | Beam destroys Scorpion if massed |
| **Fortress** | Good Counter | Usually wins if enemy masses Fortresses |

### What Scorpion Beats

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Steel Ball** | Hard Counter | High single-target DPS destroys them |
| **Sledgehammer** | Hard Counter | Easily dismantles medium units |
| **War Factory** | Strong Counter | Acid Attack melts the factory and summons |
| **Barriers** | Strong Counter | Armor-piercing shreds shields |
| **Isolated Giants** | Good Counter | With Acid + Doubleshot, devastating vs single targets |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Pair with Chaff Clear** - Always bring Vulcans or Mustangs to handle Crawlers. Scorpions alone get swarmed.

2. **Don't Overcommit Early** - Buy one Scorpion without tech and wait 1-2 rounds to see the response before investing further.

3. **Acid + Range Late Game** - Mass Scorpions with Range and Acid Attack in late game for devastating area denial.

4. **Double-Shot Combo** - For giant killing, take Doubleshot + Acid. First shot creates acid, second shot does massive damage.

### Defensive Use

1. **Frontline Tank Early** - Use unteched Scorpion as a frontline tank early game. It has solid HP and can absorb damage.

2. **Protect from Air** - Always have anti-air coverage. A single Phoenix or Wasp drop can neutralize your Scorpions.

3. **Avoid EMP Units** - Scorpions rely on techs for damage. EMP units can shut down your tech investment.

### Tech Build Paths

**Anti-Medium Build:**
1. No tech early (use as tank)
2. Range Enhancement
3. Acid Attack

**Giant Killer Build:**
1. Doubleshot
2. Acid Attack
3. Field Maintenance (for sustain)

**Siege Artillery Build:**
1. Siege Mode
2. Range Enhancement
3. Acid Attack (avoid Doubleshot with this)

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Vulcan** | Excellent | Vulcan clears chaff, Scorpion handles medium/giants |
| **Mustang** | Excellent | Mustang clears chaff and provides anti-air |
| **Arclight** | Good | Both excel against medium units |
| **Melting Point** | Good | Melting Point handles giants Scorpion struggles with |

## Strengths

- Extremely high single-target damage
- Durable with good base HP
- Acid Attack provides area denial and massive damage amplification
- Effective barrier breaker
- Hard counters medium units (Steel Ball, Sledgehammer)
- War Factory counter with Acid tech

## Weaknesses

- Cannot attack air units at all
- Long reload time (4.5s base)
- Requires chaff clear support
- Vulnerable to swarms without backup
- Struggles against massed giants (Fortress, Melting Point)
- Tech-dependent for full effectiveness
