# Hound

## Overview

The Hound is a specialized anti-swarm unit that falls between chaff and medium units in the Mechabellum hierarchy. Despite its name suggesting a swarming unit, the Hound is designed to counter light units with its rapid attacks, incendiary bombs, and fire-clearing capabilities.

Hounds are versatile units that can attack both ground and air targets with adequate quantity, appropriate DPS, high speed, and even missile interception when upgraded. They excel at clearing chaff units and providing fire suppression support for your army.

### Weapon Mechanics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Attack Type** | Ranged (shotgun) |

| **Incendiary Bomb** | Launches fire bomb every 16s (40-120m range) |

**Combat Notes:**
- Quadrupedal mechs with shotguns for faces
- Shotgun-style attack with 6m splash makes them effective chaff clearers
- Level 1 Attack Enhancement allows Hounds to one-shot Crawlers
- Low per-shot damage ineffective against armored giants
- Fire Extinguisher tech clears fire/acid in 30m radius
- Incendiary Bombs can be intercepted by anti-missile systems

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Incendiary Bomb** | 300 | Launches 1 incendiary bomb every 16s (range 40-120m), igniting ground beneath enemies. |
| **Fire Extinguisher** | 200 | Clears fire and acid effects on the ground within 30m radius. |
| **Light Unit Targeting** | 150 | Prioritizes lowest-HP enemy unit within range when switching targets. |
| **Armor Enhancement** | 400 | Reduces damage by 60 per level, increases HP by 20%. |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Increases attack range by 40m. |
| **Mechanical Rage** | 300 | Increases movement speed by 4 m/s, reduces attack interval by 0.8s. |

### Tech Analysis

**Incendiary Bomb** - The signature Hound tech. Launches fire bombs every 16 seconds with 40-120m range. Devastating against all light units. With a 100-cost unit, you can position Hounds everywhere fire matters. The range is affected by the Hound's base range. Note: Fire bombs can be intercepted by anti-missile systems like Mustangs.

**Fire Extinguisher** - An "absolutely crazy tech" for countering enemy fire and acid effects. Position Hounds in front of your Crawlers or Mustangs to protect them from fire damage. Essential against fire-heavy compositions. Important: Do not combine with Range Enhancement, as increased range makes Hounds stand too far back to effectively clean fire for your frontline.

**Light Unit Targeting** - Ensures Hounds focus on the squishiest targets first. Good for maximizing chaff clear efficiency.

**Armor Enhancement** - At level 3, Hounds with Armor can tank against other chaff effectively while costing similar to level 1 tanks but with better armor scaling. Take this when you need Hounds to survive rather than deal damage.

**Range Enhancement** - Important but requires careful use:
  - DO take range if enemy chaff clear is Sledges, Wraiths, or Tarantulas (lets your chaff go in front)
  - DON'T take range if Hounds are behind short-ranged carry units
  - DON'T take range if enemy uses Mustangs/Flamers (you want Hounds to soak damage)

**Mechanical Rage** - Remove if you're not relying on Hound's main attack to clear chaff. Add later if Hounds are performing well and need more DPS.

## Counters

### What Beats Hounds

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Sabertooth** | Hard Counter | Secondary Armament tech specifically counters Hounds |
| **Mustang** | Good Counter | Fast enough to kite, intercepts fire bombs |
| **Stormcaller** | Good Counter | AOE clears Hound squads |
| **Artillery Units** | Good Counter | Outrange Hounds easily |
| **Giants** | Good Counter | Hounds have low damage vs high armor |

### What Hounds Beat

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Crawler** | Good Counter | Fire bombs devastate swarms |
| **Fang** | Good Counter | Rapid attacks and fire clear Fangs |
| **Wasp** | Good Counter | Anti-air capability handles Wasps |
| **Mustang** | Moderate | Can fight but not dominant |
| **Light Units** | Good Counter | Specialized anti-light design |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Fire Bomb Positioning** - Deploy Hounds in lanes where enemy chaff concentrates. The 16-second fire bomb cycle can devastate repeated waves.

2. **Flexible Placement** - At 100 cost, sprinkle Hounds anywhere you need fire coverage or chaff clear.

3. **Attack Upgrade Synergy** - Level 1 Attack Enhancement from the right tower allows Hounds to one-shot Crawlers, dramatically improving their effectiveness.

### Defensive Use

1. **Fire Extinguisher Support** - Position Hounds with Fire Extinguisher in front of Crawlers or Mustangs to protect them from enemy fire effects.

2. **Don't Range with Extinguisher** - If using Fire Extinguisher, DO NOT take Range Enhancement. Hounds need to be close to your units to clear fire effectively.

3. **Anti-Air Coverage** - Hounds provide cheap anti-air that can supplement your main composition.

### Tech Build Recommendations

**Standard Build:**
1. Fire Extinguisher (utility)
2. Armor Enhancement (survivability)
3. Mechanical Rage (DPS)

**Alternative Build:**
1. Range Enhancement (replaces Fire Extinguisher)
2. Armor Enhancement
3. Incendiary Bomb
4. Mechanical Rage

### Positioning Notes

- If standing behind short-ranged carry units: NO range tech
- If enemy uses Mustangs/Flamers: NO range tech (let Hounds soak damage)
- If enemy uses Sledges/Wraiths/Tarantulas: YES range tech (let chaff go ahead)

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Overlord** | Excellent | Fire Extinguisher protects from enemy fire; Hounds clear chaff for Overlord |
| **Raiden** | Excellent | Late-game Hounds complement Raiden compositions |
| **Crawler** | Good | Fire Extinguisher protects Crawlers from fire |
| **Mustang** | Good | Fire Extinguisher protects Mustangs from fire |
| **Frontline Giants** | Good | Hounds provide anti-chaff support |

## Strengths

- Specialized anti-light unit design
- Can attack both ground and air
- High movement speed
- Incendiary Bomb devastates chaff positions
- Fire Extinguisher counters fire/acid compositions
- Cheap cost (100 supply) allows flexible deployment
- Good speed and adequate DPS

## Weaknesses

- Very low HP (similar to Crawler)
- Extremely low damage per shot against armored targets
- Cannot damage giants with defense upgrades effectively
- Incendiary Bombs can be intercepted by anti-missile
- Requires careful tech choices based on matchup
- Poor frontline durability without Armor Enhancement

## Additional Notes

The Hound was added to Mechabellum on March 1, 2025, making it one of the newer Tier 1 units. Its unique role as an anti-chaff specialist with fire support capabilities makes it valuable in many compositions, especially those vulnerable to enemy fire effects.
