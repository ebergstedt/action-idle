# Farseer

## Overview

The Farseer is a versatile support unit that serves as a jack-of-all-trades. It can attack both ground and air targets, making it well-suited for covering flanks and defending against abilities like Wasp swarms. While not exceptional in any single area, the Farseer's flexibility and powerful support technologies make it a valuable mid-game power spike.

The Farseer is a **Rare unit** that can only be obtained through Random Reinforcement cards between rounds or by special starting specialists - it cannot be unlocked directly during a match.

## Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Cost** | 300 Supply |
| **Unlock Cost** | Rare (Random Reinforcement only) |
| **Unit Count** | 1 per squad |
| **Unit HP** | 11,991 |
| **Attack Damage** | 1,348 x 2 missiles (2,696 per volley) |
| **Attack Interval** | 2.0s |
| **DPS** | 1,348 (2,696 with both missiles hitting) |
| **Range** | 125m |
| **Speed** | 16 m/s |
| **Target** | Ground and Air |

### Weapon Mechanics

**Dual Missile Launcher:**
- Each Farseer fires 2 homing missiles simultaneously per attack
- Missiles can target different enemies or focus same target
- 2.0 second attack interval between volleys
- Single Farseer fires 2 missiles per volley

**Targeting Behavior:**
- Missiles have homing capability, rarely miss
- Can split fire between ground and air targets
- Prioritizes closest threats

**Missile Interception (Tech):**
- Intercepts enemy missiles within 150m range
- Continuous interception reduces efficiency over time
- Interception efficiency independent of Farseer's attack and level

*Note: Stats may vary based on game version and balance patches.*

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Increases attack range by 40m. |
| **Electromagnetic Explosion (EMP)** | 100 | Causes electromagnetic interference on hit, disabling target Tech and reducing movement speed by 40%. |
| **Missile Interceptor** | 200 | Intercepts enemy missiles within 150m. Continuous interception reduces efficiency over time. |
| **Photon Emission** | 400 | At combat start, emits photon coating on allied ground forces within 100m. Reduces damage by 30% for 20s and grants immunity to electromagnetic, ignition, and acid effects. |
| **Scanning Radar** | 300 | Aura increases range of all allied units within 100m by 10. Effects don't stack from multiple Farseers. |

### Tech Analysis

**EMP (Electromagnetic Explosion)** - The best and most used technology on Farseer. At only 100 cost, it's incredibly efficient. Strong against teched giants, Wraiths, and even targets like assault Marksmen and Scorpions. This should almost always be your first tech.

**Photon Emission** - Very strong if you get the Farseer drop when you specifically need photon protection. Remember it only affects ground units. Great for protecting your army from acid, fire, and EMP effects.

**Range Enhancement** - Generally not recommended. The Farseer's damage output is low, so extending its range provides minimal value.

**Missile Interceptor** - Rarely useful. You need multiple Farseers to make interception work, and 99.5% of games don't justify this tech.

**Scanning Radar** - Too expensive for its effect. Requires multiple Farseers to cover relevant units, making it cost-inefficient.

## Counters

### What Beats Farseer

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Fortress** | Hard Counter | With Range tech, Fortress destroys Farseers |
| **Sandworm** | Hard Counter | Can destroy Farseer-heavy boards |
| **Any High-Damage Unit** | Strong Counter | Farseer has low HP and damage |

### What Farseer Beats

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Wasp** | Strong Counter | Excellent at preventing Wasp plays |
| **Wraith** | Good Counter | EMP shuts down Wraith techs |
| **Overlord (on drop)** | Good Counter | Counters Overlord the turn it appears |

### Important Note on Countering

Farseers themselves don't need direct counters - they are a support unit. If you counter the rest of the enemy army, the Farseer becomes useless due to its low damage and HP.

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Mid-Game Power Spike** - Farseer offers huge value on rounds 3-5, but quickly falls off afterward.

2. **Aggressive Positioning** - With its high speed and Photon Emission, Farseer can support aggressive pushes effectively.

3. **EMP First** - Almost always tech EMP first. At 100 cost, it provides enormous value against teched opponents.

### Defensive Use

1. **Flank Protection** - Position Farseers on flanks to cover against aerial threats and surprise attacks.

2. **Anti-Cheese Protection** - Farseer protects against random cheese plays like Wasp swarms, Wraith pushes, and sudden Overlord drops.

3. **Support Role** - Remember Farseer is a support unit. Don't overcommit to building more.

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Support Build:**
1. EMP (first and often only tech)
2. Photon Emission (if needed)

**Defensive Build:**
1. Photon Emission (protect ground army)
2. EMP (disable enemy techs)

### Common Mistakes

- **Over-investing in Farseers** - If you build multiple Farseers and tech them heavily, you'll lose to better units late game.
- **Taking Range Tech** - Range provides minimal value on a low-damage support unit.
- **Building Too Many** - Only build 1-2 more in mid-game, then forget about the unit.

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Ground Giants** | Excellent | Photon Emission protects giants from debuffs |
| **Aggressive Pushes** | Good | High speed lets Farseer keep up with rushes |
| **Anti-Air Composition** | Good | Helps cover aerial blind spots |

## Farseer Specialist

The Farseer Specialist is considered particularly strong among unit-providing specialists because it grants a highly versatile Rare unit. You receive one Rank One Farseer at the start of Round Three, unlocking the ability to purchase up to two additional Farseers per round.

## Strengths

- Versatile support that attacks both ground and air
- EMP tech is extremely cost-efficient at 100 supply
- High speed (16 m/s) for repositioning
- Photon Emission provides powerful team-wide protection
- Excellent mid-game power spike
- Prevents cheese strategies (Wasp, Wraith, Overlord)

## Weaknesses

- Low damage output - not a carry unit
- Low HP - easily killed by focused fire
- Falls off hard after mid-game
- Rare unit - cannot be reliably obtained
- Support role means it depends on army to function
- Many techs are inefficient or situational
