# Fang

## Overview

Fangs are cheap, slow-moving, and versatile chaff units that can be customized to fulfill a variety of battlefield roles. Without upgrades, Fangs are effective at killing fragile air units such as Wasps and Phoenixes, and are moderately effective against both chaff and single targets thanks to their high rate of fire.

Fangs excel in a support role - they are rarely the star of your army but consistently provide value as damage shields, air defense, and supplementary firepower. Their high unit count makes them excellent at drawing fire from high single-target damage units.

## Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Cost** | 100 Supply |
| **Unlock Cost** | 0 (Starting Unit) |
| **Unit Count** | 18 per squad |
| **Unit HP** | 117 |
| **Squad HP** | 2,106 |
| **Damage per Attack** | 61 |
| **Attack Interval** | 1.5s (1.0s with Mechanical Rage) |
| **Squad DPS** | 732 |
| **Range** | 75m (115m with Range Enhancement) |
| **Speed** | 6 m/s (Slowest in game) |
| **Target** | Air + Ground |

### Weapon Mechanics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Attack Type** | Ranged (laser blaster) |
| **Projectile** | Energy bolt (fast travel time) |
| **AoE/Splash** | None (single target) |
| **Targets per Attack** | 1 |
| **Special** | Base damage (61) barely exceeds Armor Enhancement threshold (60) |

**Combat Notes:**
- Each Fang fires independently at targets within range
- Laser blaster on right arm provides consistent single-target damage
- High unit count (18) makes them effective at absorbing single-target fire
- Base damage of 61 is only 1 point over the 60 damage blocked by Armor Enhancement tech at same level
- Slowest base movement speed in the game (6 m/s) keeps them from outpacing ranged allies

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Ignite** | 200 | Attacks have a chance to ignite targets. Ignited units lose 6% HP/sec for 2s. |
| **Portable Shield** | 500 | Each Fang gets an energy shield equal to its HP that blocks at least one hit. |
| **Armor-Piercing Bullets** | 250 | Increases ATK by 50%. Late-game carry option. |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Increases attack range by 40m. |
| **Mechanical Rage** | 300 | Increases movement speed by 5 m/s and reduces attack interval by 0.5s. |

### Tech Analysis

**Ignite** - Outstanding against giant units. The 6% HP/sec burn damage scales with enemy max HP, making it devastating against Fortresses, Melting Points, and War Factories. Best used with Fortress's Fang Summoning tech to maximize burn uptime. Only upgrade this if there is a giant in front of your Fangs.

**Portable Shield** - The premier defensive tech for Fangs. Makes them significantly more durable against burst damage (Fortresses, Marksmen) and notably more survivable against weak but numerous attacks (Mustangs, other Fangs). However, provides little benefit against multi-hit AOE (Stormcallers, Overlords) or fast-attacking units (Arclights). Shielded Fangs become excellent damage shields.

**Armor-Piercing Bullets** - A late-game carry option that is generally considered ineffective. The cost is better spent on other units.

**Range Enhancement** - Enables "carry" Fang builds, though these are considered suboptimal. Useful for keeping Fangs safer while dealing damage.

**Mechanical Rage** - Excellent synergy with Fortress's Fang Summoning. The speed helps summoned Fangs reach Melting Points faster, and the reduced attack interval clears Crawlers more effectively.

## Counters

### What Beats Fangs

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Mustang** | Hard Counter | Cost-effective AOE clears Fang swarms easily |
| **Stormcaller** | Hard Counter | Long-range AOE devastates grouped Fangs |
| **Vulcan** | Hard Counter | Rapid-fire AOE; Fangs stand no chance |
| **Overlord** | Hard Counter | Massive AOE attacks |
| **Arclight** | Good Counter | Can one-shot Fangs, though slower clear than vs Crawlers |
| **Sledgehammer** | Good Counter | AOE melee clears Fangs efficiently |

### What Fangs Beat

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Wasp** | Good Counter | High rate of fire effective against fragile air |
| **Phoenix** | Good Counter | Rapid attacks kill before Phoenix can deal significant damage |
| **Crawler** | Moderate | Higher range allows kiting, but Crawlers can overwhelm if they connect |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Anti-Air Screen** - Unupgraded Fangs provide cheap and effective defense against early Wasps and Phoenixes.

2. **Giant Killer Combo** - Pair Fangs with Fortress using Fang Summoning. Apply Ignite tech for devastating burn damage against enemy giants.

3. **Never Solo** - Fangs should always support other units. By themselves, they are practically useless as army mainstays.

### Defensive Use

1. **Damage Shield** - Fangs excel at drawing fire from enemy single-target damage dealers due to high unit count.

2. **Better Shield Than Crawlers** - Fangs make better damage shields than Crawlers because their slower speed keeps them from outpacing your ranged units and getting killed before battle begins.

3. **Portable Shield Priority** - If using Fangs as meat shields against slow, high-damage units, Portable Shield is essential.

### Positioning

1. **Mid-Range Placement** - Place Fangs in the middle rows where they can shoot while your frontline absorbs initial contact.

2. **Avoid AOE Zones** - Keep Fangs spread to minimize Stormcaller and Overlord effectiveness.

3. **Fortress Synergy** - When using Fortress Fang Summoning, position Fortress where summoned Fangs will immediately engage priority targets.

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Fortress** | Excellent | Fang Summoning creates continuous pressure; Ignite burns giants |
| **Marksman** | Good | Fangs absorb fire while Marksmen deal damage from safety |
| **Melting Point** | Good | Fangs screen for the slow-firing artillery |
| **Any Backline DPS** | Good | Fangs soak damage, protecting your damage dealers |

## Strengths

- Anti-air capability from the start (no tech required)
- High unit count (18 units) absorbs single-target damage
- Versatile support unit fitting many compositions
- Cheap cost (100 supply) allows flexible deployment
- Portable Shield dramatically increases survivability
- Ignite tech devastates giant units

## Weaknesses

- Very slow movement speed (6 m/s base)
- Weak to almost all AOE damage sources
- Cannot carry games alone - always needs support
- Vulnerable to Stormcallers and Vulcans regardless of tech
- Low individual HP makes them fragile
- Portable Shield ineffective against multi-hit AOE
