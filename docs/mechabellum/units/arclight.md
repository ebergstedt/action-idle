# Arclight

## Overview

The Arclight is a versatile ranged unit that serves two main purposes in your army. First, it acts as a cheap and efficient chaff clearer - capable of one-shotting Crawlers, Fangs, Mustangs, and Wasps with enough attack speed and range to destroy them before they deal significant damage. Second, with sufficient levels and offensive tech upgrades, Arclights transform into "carry" units - long-range, high-DPS threats capable of attacking both ground and air units.

Fully upgraded Arclights function similarly to Marksmen but fire significantly faster and are not countered by chaff units, making them excellent scaling units for late-game compositions.

## Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Cost** | 100 Supply |
| **Unlock Cost** | 0 (Starting Unit) |
| **Unit Count** | 1 (Single Module) |
| **HP** | 4,813 |
| **Damage per Attack** | 347 |
| **Attack Interval** | 0.9s |
| **DPS** | 385 |
| **Splash Radius** | 7m (reduced from original 6m, then adjusted) |
| **Range** | 95m (135m with Range Enhancement) |
| **Speed** | 7 m/s |
| **Target** | Ground only (Air + Ground with Anti-Aircraft Ammunition) |

### Weapon Mechanics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Attack Type** | Ranged (artillery shell) |
| **Projectile** | Ballistic shell with arc |
| **AoE/Splash** | 7m radius (diameter = ~4 Crawler lengths) |
| **Splash Falloff** | Full damage within splash radius |
| **Rotation Speed** | 80 deg/s (slow turret rotation) |
| **Targets per Attack** | Multiple (all units in splash) |

**Combat Notes:**
- One-shots Crawlers (263 HP), Fangs (117 HP), Mustangs (343 HP), and Wasps with AA tech
- Single module means only one target can be locked at a time
- Splash damage hits 2-3 small units per shot against scattered enemies
- Slow rotation speed means nearby flanking units may not be targeted quickly
- High-Explosive Ammo tech adds +7m splash radius but reduces ATK by 40%

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Charged Shot** | 150 | Increases ATK by 300% but increases attack interval by 35%. Core carry tech. |
| **Elite Marksman** | 400 | Effect scales with level: +5m range and +22% ATK per level. |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Increases attack range by 40m. |
| **Armor Enhancement** | 150 | HP increased by 35% and 60 damage blocked when attacked. Blocking increases by 60 per level. |
| **Anti-Aircraft Ammunition** | 300 | Can target aerial units. |
| **Electromagnetic Shot (EMP)** | 200 | Disables target's tech and reduces movement speed by 40%. |

### Tech Analysis

**Charged Shot** - The cornerstone of carry Arclight builds. Despite the name, it does not force Arclights to charge their shots or increase attack interval. Pure 200% ATK increase makes this essential for damage-focused builds.

**Elite Marksman** - The tech that unlocks Arclight's late-game potential. With levels + Elite Marksman + Charged Shot, Arclights obliterate everything. The scaling (+5m range, +25% ATK per level) becomes absurd at high levels. Usually the second tech after Charged Shot on carry builds.

**Range Enhancement** - Take this if your Arclights are dying before clearing enemy chaff. Useful against aggressive Steel Ball pushes where range matters less (take Charged Shot first instead). Essential when facing lots of chaff that threatens to reach your backline.

**Armor Enhancement** - Excellent for flanking Arclights or when defending against pushes. Helps survive against Crawlers and Mustangs when positioned forward. The scaling per level makes it increasingly effective.

**Anti-Aircraft Ammunition** - Turns Arclights into all-purpose units. However, the cost is often better spent on dedicated anti-air like Mustangs. Can be problematic if high-level Arclights get stuck targeting shielded Wasps instead of priority ground targets.

**Electromagnetic Shot** - Situational but powerful. Use to disable Crawler acid explosions, Steel Ball techs, or pin down enemies for your other units. Arclights' splash damage makes EMP hit multiple targets.

## Counters

### What Beats Arclights

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Marksman** | Hard Counter | Longer range, high single-target damage |
| **Stormcaller** | Hard Counter | Outranges Arclights and has devastating AOE |
| **Rhino** | Hard Counter | Closes distance quickly, high HP and damage |
| **Fortress** | Hard Counter | Tanky with Fang Summoning to overwhelm |
| **Phoenix** | Good Counter | Air unit Arclights cannot hit without AA tech |
| **Wraith** | Good Counter | Air unit with good damage |
| **Overlord** | Good Counter | Massive AOE can hit Arclights |
| **Scorpion** | Good Counter | Artillery outranges and outdamages |

### What Arclights Beat

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Crawler** | Hard Counter | One-shots Crawlers; fast enough to clear swarms |
| **Fang** | Hard Counter | One-shots Fangs efficiently |
| **Mustang** | Hard Counter | Clears Mustang swarms effectively |
| **Steel Ball** | Good Counter | AOE damages multiple Balls, especially with Charged Shot |
| **Sledgehammer** | Good Counter | Can kite and deal consistent damage |
| **Fire Badger** | Good Counter | Outranges and clears before they close |
| **Typhoon** | Good Counter | AOE clears the cluster |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use (Carry Build)

1. **Level Investment** - Carry Arclights need levels to scale. Protect them early so they can farm experience.

2. **Tech Timing** - Against Steel Balls, take Charged Shot first (range not needed). Against heavy chaff, take Range first.

3. **Positioning** - Place Arclights in the backline with chaff clearer support.

### Defensive Use (Chaff Clearer)

1. **Marksman Bodyguard** - Always place an Arclight next to your Marksman. The Arclight clears Crawlers/Fangs so the Marksman can focus on valuable targets.

2. **No Tech Needed** - Unupgraded Arclights are effective chaff clearers. Save money for other units.

3. **Forward Flanks** - Place Arclights on flanks to intercept Crawler and Fang rushes before they reach your core.

### Counter Play

1. **Air Pressure** - If enemy is going carry Arclights, deploy air units (Wasps, Phoenixes) to force them off the Arclight strategy.

2. **Fortress Response** - Fortress with Fang Summoning demolishes any carry Arclight attempt.

### Tech Build Paths

**Carry Build:**
1. Charged Shot (damage foundation)
2. Elite Marksman (scaling)
3. Range Enhancement (safety)

**Flanking Build:**
1. Armor Enhancement (survivability)
2. Charged Shot (damage)

**Anti-Air Flex Build:**
1. Anti-Aircraft Ammunition
2. Charged Shot

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Marksman** | Excellent | Arclights clear chaff, Marksmen kill priority targets |
| **Melting Point** | Good | Arclight handles chaff while Melting Point handles giants |
| **Stormcaller** | Good | Both benefit from backline positioning |
| **Overlord** | Good | Overlord AOE clears threats to Arclights |

## Strengths

- Cheap and effective chaff clearer (100 supply)
- One-shots most chaff units
- Splash damage hits multiple targets
- Scales extremely well with levels and tech
- Versatile role (support or carry)
- Can gain anti-air capability

## Weaknesses

- Cannot hit air units without Anti-Aircraft tech
- Low HP makes them vulnerable to single-target burst
- Slow movement speed; vulnerable to flanks
- Struggles against non-chaff units without tech
- Hard countered by Stormcallers
- Requires investment to become a carry
