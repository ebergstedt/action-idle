# Mustang

## Overview

The Mustang is one of the most versatile units in Mechabellum. These fast-moving mechanized cavalry units are equipped with rapid-fire cannons that can target both air and ground units. Mustangs are solid all-around units that can be teched to fit many different purposes, serving as your army's main damage dealer or anti-air specialists.

Mustangs excel at clearing chaff units like Fangs and Crawlers in the early game while providing crucial protection against air units. Their high speed allows deployment to cover flanks even when pushing with other units.

## Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Cost** | 200 Supply |
| **Unlock Cost** | 50 Supply |
| **Unit Count** | 12 per squad |
| **HP per Unit** | 343 |
| **Total Squad HP** | 4,116 |
| **Damage per Shot** | 36 |
| **Attack Interval** | 0.4 seconds |
| **DPS per Unit** | 90 |
| **Squad DPS** | 1,080 |
| **Range** | 95m |
| **Speed** | 16 m/s |
| **Target** | Air and Ground |
| **Attack Type** | Projectile (rapid-fire cannon) |
| **Splash Radius** | None (0m base; 7m with High-Explosive Ammo tech) |

### Weapon Mechanics

**Attack Type:** Projectile-based rapid-fire autocannon

- **Projectile Speed:** Fast hitscan-like projectiles
- **Fire Pattern:** Continuous rapid fire at 2.5 shots/second per unit
- **Splash Damage:** No base splash (0m); High-Explosive Ammo adds 7m splash at -35% ATK
- **Armor Interaction:** Low damage per shot (36) means Armor Enhancement is extremely effective against Mustangs - each point of armor reduction applies to every shot

**DPS Breakdown:**
- Single Mustang: 36 damage / 0.4s = 90 DPS
- Full Squad (12 units): 90 x 12 = 1,080 DPS
- Effective DPS vs armored targets is significantly reduced

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Increases attack range by 40m. Usually the first tech to get. |
| **High-Explosive Ammo** | 50 | Increases splash damage range by 7m, but reduces ATK by 35%. Good vs Fangs, Crawlers, and Wasps. |
| **Armor-Piercing Bullets** | 300 | Increases ATK by 50%. Late game tech for high-level carry Mustangs. Great vs barrier shields, Sledgehammers, Overlord, and armored units. |
| **Aerial Specialization** | 300 | ATK increases by 90% to aerial units, increases range by 30 when attacking aerial units. Must-have for air battles. |
| **Missile Intercept** | 200 | Mustang will attempt to intercept enemy missiles within 150m (battlefield skills cannot be intercepted). Continuous interception decreases success rate over time. |

### Tech Analysis

**Range Enhancement** - Almost always the first tech to pick. Extra range keeps your Mustangs safer and allows them to engage before enemies can close the gap. Essential before investing in damage techs.

**High-Explosive Ammo** - Very cheap (50 supply) and best against swarm units (Fangs, Crawlers, Wasps). Consider this if the enemy is leaning into Crawlers. If you already have several Mustang squads, HE is a good answer to Crawlers.

**Armor-Piercing Bullets** - Late game technology for high-level carry Mustangs. Great vs barrier shields, Sledgehammers, Overlord, and armored units. Always buy Range before this tech. Note: Buffs are additive, so this provides diminishing returns if you already have Advanced Firepower Control System (+200% damage).

**Aerial Specialization** - Must-have tech for inevitable air battles. The main benefit is the range increase, which keeps your Mustangs far from Vulcans and fire damage while shooting down air units. Tech this when the enemy has 3+ Overlords/Wasps or has invested in air unit techs. Don't upgrade too early though - base Mustangs handle early Wasps and Phoenixes well.

**Missile Intercept** - Very powerful tech against Stormcallers. As a rule: 3 units of Mustangs can consistently intercept missiles from 1 unit of Stormcallers. 2 units intercept about 7 volleys before being overwhelmed. Important: Mustangs using all shots to intercept missiles lose 20-40% DPS against other targets, making your other techs less useful. Level 3 Mustangs intercept the same number of missiles as Level 1.

## Counters

### What Beats Mustangs

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Fortress** | Hard Counter | Mustang's worst nightmare. Too much HP for Mustangs to deal with. |
| **Arclight** | Good Counter | Does double duty of clearing chaff |
| **Sledgehammer** | Good Counter | With Armor Enhancement, tanks Mustang damage well |
| **Stormcaller** | Good Counter | Great if Mustangs are paired with Fangs or slow units |
| **Vulcan** | Good Counter | High damage output overwhelms Mustangs |
| **Rhino** | Good Counter | Fast engagement, high HP |
| **Tarantula** | Good Counter | With Armor tech, very hard for Mustangs to kill |
| **Fire Badger** | Good Counter | Tanky frontline that clears Mustangs |
| **Typhoon** | Good Counter | AOE devastates Mustang squads |

### What Mustangs Beat

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Fang** | Hard Counter | Excellent against Fangs, especially with HE Ammo |
| **Phoenix** | Hard Counter | Phoenixes don't stand a chance |
| **Wasp** | Hard Counter | Only Overlord can face Mustangs in the air |
| **Crawler** | Good Counter | OK counter; HE Ammo helps significantly |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Versatile Deployment** - Spread Mustangs throughout your army's layout. They support other units while providing anti-air coverage.

2. **Flank Coverage** - Use their high speed to deploy on flanks even while pushing with other units.

3. **Early Game Strength** - Mustangs are excellent early game against Fangs and provide protection against early air units.

4. **Damage Carry** - When equipped with a damage item and levels, Mustangs can kill almost everything.

### Defensive Use

1. **Anti-Air Defense** - Primary purpose is defending against aerial threats. Keep them positioned to intercept air attacks.

2. **Missile Shield** - With Missile Intercept tech, Mustangs can neutralize Stormcaller threats.

3. **Support Role** - Pair with units that cover Mustang weaknesses (giants, Steel Balls, Rhinos).

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Build:**
1. Range Enhancement
2. Aerial Specialization or Armor-Piercing Bullets (based on enemy composition)

**Anti-Stormcaller Build:**
1. Range Enhancement
2. Missile Intercept

**Anti-Swarm Build:**
1. Range Enhancement
2. High-Explosive Ammo

### General Advice

- When approaching late game, don't build too many Mustangs. Once you have 3-4 packs, invest in supporting units as enemies will build counters.
- You may use Mustangs as frontline units, but be aware opponents will counter with Fortresses.
- Always pick Range before damage-increasing techs.

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Hacker** | Excellent | Hackers serve as barrier for Mustangs |
| **Fortress** | Excellent | Protects Mustangs from fast units and giants |
| **Steel Ball** | Excellent | Same movement speed, cover each other's weaknesses |
| **Rhino** | Good | Rhinos handle giants that counter Mustangs |

## Strengths

- Most versatile unit in the game
- Can target both air and ground
- High movement speed (16 m/s)
- Excellent chaff clearing ability
- Strong anti-air capabilities
- Can be teched for many different purposes
- Scales well with levels and items

## Weaknesses

- Vulnerable to armor technologies
- Cannot effectively deal with Single-Entity units (too much HP)
- Big units and shields are problematic
- High fire rate but low damage per shot means armor is very effective against them
- Requires support when enemies build counters
