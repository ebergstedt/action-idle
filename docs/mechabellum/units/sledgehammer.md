# Sledgehammer

## Overview

The Sledgehammer is a durable, well-rounded ranged tank that excels at holding the line. Truly a heavy tank in every definition, Sledgehammers don't specialize in killing any particular unit but can be customized to serve a variety of battlefield roles. Without upgrades, they deal decent single-target damage in a small area with a relatively slow rate of fire.

Sledgehammers are the most reliable unit for creating a solid frontline. They have twice the single-target DPS and four times the health of Arclights, making them a better generalist unit. Their high health spread across 5 models allows them to shrug off small arms fire while serving as a speed bump against bigger threats.

## Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Cost** | 200 Supply |
| **Unlock Cost** | 50 Supply |
| **Unit Count** | 5 per squad |
| **HP per Unit** | 3,478 |
| **Total Squad HP** | 17,390 |
| **Damage per Shot** | 608 |
| **Attack Interval** | 4.5 seconds |
| **DPS per Unit** | 135 |
| **Squad DPS** | 675 |
| **Range** | 95m |
| **Speed** | 7 m/s |
| **Target** | Ground Only |
| **Attack Type** | Projectile (explosive shell) |
| **Splash Radius** | Small (~5m diameter, roughly 3 Crawlers wide) |

### Weapon Mechanics

**Attack Type:** Explosive projectile cannon

- **Projectile Speed:** Medium-speed ballistic shells
- **Fire Pattern:** Single shot every 4.5 seconds per unit
- **Splash Damage:** Small AOE splash (~5m diameter), deals full damage in blast radius
- **Armor Interaction:** High damage per shot (608) means a larger portion of each hit bypasses armor compared to rapid-fire units

**DPS Comparison:**
- Sledgehammer has 2x the single-target DPS of Arclights
- Sledgehammer has 4x the HP of Arclights
- Lower splash radius and fire rate than Arclight makes it slightly worse at killing chaff
- High damage per shot makes it effective against armored medium units

**Damage Calculation:**
- Single Sledgehammer: 608 damage / 4.5s = 135 DPS
- Full Squad (5 units): 135 x 5 = 675 DPS
- High damage per shot makes Sledgehammers good against shields

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Field Maintenance** | 200 | Increases HP by 30%, automatically restores 4.5% Max HP per second upon taking damage. Almost always the first (and only) tech. |
| **Armor Enhancement** | 300 | Reduces damage received by 60 per level, increases HP by 20%. Good against Mustangs or Vulcans. |
| **Mechanical Rage** | 300 | Increases movement speed by 4 m/s and reduces attack interval by 1.5s. Increases DPS and chaff clear speed. |
| **Electromagnetic Shot** | 300 | Causes electromagnetic interference on hit, temporarily disabling target's Tech and reducing movement speed by 40%. |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Increases attack range by 40m. Not usually recommended - you want Sledges tanking, not in backline. |
| **Armor-Piercing Bullets** | 250 | Increases ATK by 150% and attack interval increases by 20%. Gives enough damage to threaten anything smaller than a Vulcan. |
| **Damage Sharing** | 200 | Chains adjacent Sledgehammers together, increasing HP by 120% and sharing damage received equally. Dangerous - vulnerable to Melting Point. |

### Tech Analysis

**Field Maintenance** - Almost always the first (and only) tech on Sledgehammers. At 200 cost, it's incredible value. The 30% HP increase plus constant regeneration makes Sledgehammers extremely durable. This is usually all you need.

**Armor Enhancement** - Usually teched against Mustangs or Vulcans. Can be very effective against Crawlers if they don't have Impact Drill available. The damage reduction per level stacks well.

**Electromagnetic Shot** - Counters many nasty enemy technologies: armor enhancements, Crawler acid, Steel Ball lifesteal, and Mechanical Division. Very useful situational tech.

**Mechanical Rage** - Useful as both offensive and defensive tool. Increases overall DPS while improving chaff clear speed. The movement speed helps Sledgehammers take less damage from Stormcallers and Overlords.

**Range Enhancement** - Not usually a good tech since you want Sledgehammers to serve as a tanking unit, not a backline damage dealer. Can work with the high-range Sledgehammer card.

**Armor-Piercing Bullets** - Gives them 200% extra damage (with slight fire rate decrease), enough to threaten anything smaller than a Vulcan. Good damage upgrade option.

**Damage Sharing** - Use with extreme caution. While it provides fast power spikes, you get countered early by Steel Balls and late game by Melting Point. 16 Sledgehammers can simultaneously explode to a drilling Melting Point. If you don't know what you're doing, avoid this tech.

## Counters

### What Beats Sledgehammers

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Fortress** | Hard Counter | Just too tanky, Sledgehammers can't deal with them |
| **Scorpion** | Hard Counter | High single-target damage from range |
| **Overlord** | Hard Counter | Massive damage Sledges can't answer |
| **Hacker** | Good Counter | Can hack Sledgehammers without much resistance |
| **Phoenix** | Good Counter | Flying high-damage dealer Sledges can't target |
| **War Factory** | Good Counter | Outclasses Sledgehammers entirely |
| **Marksman** | Good Counter | Long-range damage with no answer |
| **Rhino** | Good Counter | Fast engagement, high damage |
| **Stormcaller** | Good Counter | Slow speed makes them vulnerable to rockets |
| **Steel Ball** | Good Counter | Lasers chew through Sledgehammers efficiently |

### What Sledgehammers Beat

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Crawler** | Hard Counter | Excellent chaff clear with AOE damage |
| **Mustang** | Good Counter | Tanks their damage, especially with Armor tech |
| **Stormcaller** | Good Counter | Can close distance and survive to engage |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Frontline Tank** - Primary role is to provide a frontline for your damage dealers. Sledgehammers tank damage while backline units deal damage safely.

2. **Early Game Chaff Clear** - In early game, Sledgehammers excel at clearing Crawlers and Fangs. Throughout the game they remain excellent vs Crawlers but struggle against shielded Fangs.

### Defensive Use

1. **Hold the Line** - Sledgehammers are the most reliable unit for holding the line. Position them to absorb damage for your more fragile units.

2. **Protect Bigger Units** - In midgame, Sledgehammers assist in chaff clear and provide a frontline for your bigger damage dealers. They tank Vulcans, Typhoons, and Wraiths well.

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Build:**
1. Field Maintenance (often the only tech needed)

**Anti-Mustang/Vulcan Build:**
1. Field Maintenance
2. Armor Enhancement

**Tech Disruption Build:**
1. Field Maintenance
2. Electromagnetic Shot

**Damage Build:**
1. Armor-Piercing Bullets
2. Field Maintenance

### General Advice

- Don't tech Sledgehammers too early - they are hard countered by multiple units (Scorpions, Fortress, Overlords).
- Be wary of Damage Sharing. If the enemy gets a Melting Point, your linked Sledgehammers will all die together.
- Field Maintenance provides incredible value for its cost. Usually this is all your Sledgehammers need.

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Fang** | Excellent | Fangs provide anti-air, both can flex roles based on enemy composition |
| **Mustang** | Good | Sledges tank while Mustangs deal damage |
| **Stormcaller** | Good | Sledges protect Stormcallers from fast units |
| **Marksman** | Good | Sledges frontline for squishy Marksmen |

## Strengths

- Very durable (4x health of Arclights)
- Good single-target DPS (2x that of Arclights)
- Excellent early game chaff clear
- Reliable frontline unit
- Field Maintenance tech provides incredible value
- Can be customized for many roles
- High health spread across 5 models absorbs small arms fire

## Weaknesses

- Slow movement speed
- Cannot attack air units
- Vulnerable to high damage-per-shot attacks (Phoenixes)
- Weak to Stormcallers due to slow speed
- Gets stuck on shielded Fangs
- Single-entity units (Fortress, Scorpion) outclass them
- Steel Balls shred them efficiently
