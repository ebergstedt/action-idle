# Marksman

## Overview

The Marksman is an inexpensive unit that specializes in destroying single targets with powerful long-range attacks. Think of it as a cost-effective version of the Melting Point - dealing massive damage from exceptional range while remaining cheap enough to deploy early.

A team of Marksmen deployed in the back of your army can easily rack up kills from a safe distance. Since they are cheap and can be fielded early, Marksmen rapidly gain experience and levels given the relative safety from which they operate. However, their fragile defenses and low fire rate make them extremely vulnerable to squads with high unit counts like Crawlers or Mustangs.

## Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Cost** | 100 Supply |
| **Unlock Cost** | 0 (Starting Unit) |
| **Unit Count** | 1 (Single Module) |
| **HP** | 1,622 |
| **Damage per Attack** | 2,329 |
| **Attack Interval** | 3.1s |
| **DPS** | 751 |
| **Range** | 140m (180m with Range Enhancement) |
| **Speed** | 8 m/s |
| **Target** | Air + Ground |

### Weapon Mechanics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Attack Type** | Ranged (sniper rifle) |
| **Projectile** | High-velocity bullet (fast travel time, not hitscan) |
| **AoE/Splash** | None (single target) |
| **Targets per Attack** | 1 |
| **Overkill Waste** | High - slow fire rate means wasted damage on weak targets |

**Combat Notes:**
- Damage (2,329) is 143% of its own HP (1,622) - a true glass cannon
- Two Marksmen firing at each other at same range results in mutual destruction
- Second longest base range in game (140m), only Stormcaller (180m) outranges
- Quick Reload tech halves interval to 1.55s but also halves damage
- Doubleshot fires 2 bullets per attack with +15% reload time
- Can target air units by default (no tech required)

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Increases attack range by 40m. Priority tech in most games. |
| **Elite Marksman** | 400 | +8m range and +20% ATK per level. Late-game scaling tech. |
| **Aerial Specialization** | 200 | +75% ATK vs air, +30 range when attacking air. |
| **Quick Reload** | 300 | Multiplies attack speed but reduces damage per shot. |
| **Doubleshot** | 300 | Fires 2 bullets per attack, increases reload by 15%. |
| **Electromagnetic Shot (EMP)** | 300 | Disables enemy tech and reduces movement speed by 40%. |
| **Assault Mode** | 150 | -70 range, +500% HP, +3 m/s speed, attacks gain 9m area damage. |
| **Shooting Squad** | 300 | Spawns 5 Fangs at Marksman's level at battle start. |

### Tech Analysis

**Range Enhancement** - Take this first 90% of the time. Marksmen are all about range superiority. The 40m increase ensures you outrange almost everything and can safely deal damage without retaliation.

**Elite Marksman** - The tech that makes Marksmen late-game powerhouses. The +8m range and +20% ATK per level scaling is exceptional given how safely Marksmen farm experience. Usually the second tech after Range Enhancement.

**Aerial Specialization** - Very powerful against early Wraiths or Overlords. The +75% ATK and +30 range specifically for air targets makes Marksmen deadly anti-air.

**Quick Reload** - Halves attack interval but also halves damage per shot. Better for clearing medium units (Sledgehammers, Phoenixes) where attack speed matters more than per-shot damage. Also good against Hackers and late-game Fangs. Helps when multiple Marksmen target the same unit - overkill damage is wasted, so faster shots transition to new targets quicker.

**Doubleshot** - Fires two bullets per attack at cost of 15% longer reload. Excellent against Phoenixes with Portable Shield (first shot breaks shield, second kills). Boosts single-target damage further for giant killing.

**Electromagnetic Shot** - Extremely useful tech. Counters respawning Phoenixes, holds giants in place, and disables enemy range upgrades. Very powerful utility option.

**Assault Mode** - Transforms Marksmen into frontline fighters. -70 range, +500% HP, +3 m/s speed, and 9m area damage turns bad defensive starts into decent aggressive compositions. Use against Fortress or Scorpion pushes.

**Shooting Squad** - Spawns 5 Fangs at battle start. Only effective if you field large numbers of Marksmen. Generally inefficient.

### Quick Reload vs Doubleshot

- **Quick Reload** wins when multiple Marksmen target the same unit (less overkill, faster target switching)
- **Quick Reload** clears medium units faster
- **Doubleshot** wins for single-target burst against giants
- **Doubleshot** counters Portable Shield Phoenixes
- Generally, Quick Reload is more consistent for most situations

## Counters

### What Beats Marksmen

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Crawler** | Hard Counter | Swarms overwhelm single-target damage |
| **Rhino** | Hard Counter | Huge HP pool, incredible speed, devastating close-range damage |
| **Mustang** | Hard Counter | Fast, numerous, closes distance quickly |
| **Wasp** | Hard Counter | Air swarm, cannot be targeted without tech |
| **Stormcaller** | Hard Counter | Outranges Marksmen and deals AOE |
| **Fang** | Good Counter | High unit count absorbs shots |
| **Fortress** | Good Counter | Tanky with Fang Summoning to overwhelm |
| **Scorpion** | Good Counter | Artillery with protective range |

### What Marksmen Beat

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Arclight** | Good Counter | Outranges and out-damages |
| **Sledgehammer** | Good Counter | Single-target damage is effective |
| **Melting Point** | Good Counter | Cost-effective trade at range |
| **Wraith** | Good Counter (with Aerial Spec) | Air specialization makes them deadly anti-air |
| **Overlord** | Good Counter (with Aerial Spec) | High damage threatens the giant air unit |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Safe Farming** - Position Marksmen in the back where they can safely accumulate kills and levels. High-level Marksmen become game-winning threats.

2. **Supporting Fire** - Multiple Marksmen focus priority targets while your frontline absorbs damage.

3. **Aerial Specialization Timing** - Tech into Aerial Spec early if you spot Wraiths or Overlords in opponent's composition.

### Defensive Use

1. **Always Have Chaff Clearers** - Never deploy Marksmen without Arclights or similar units to handle Crawlers/Fangs.

2. **Spread Deployment** - Spread Marksmen to avoid Stormcaller AOE and make flanking harder.

3. **Sell Before Replicate** - If enemy has Replicate Crawlers approaching your isolated Marksman, sell it to deny the farm.

### Counter Play

1. **Stormcaller Response** - Two Stormcallers early game counter Marksman-heavy openings effectively.

2. **Rhino Flanks** - If enemy overcommits to Marksmen, Rhino flanks are devastating.

3. **Assault Mode Defense** - Against Assault Marksmen pushes, respond with Fortress or Scorpion.

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Carry Build:**
1. Range Enhancement (safety and reach)
2. Elite Marksman (scaling)
3. Quick Reload or Doubleshot (DPS boost)

**Anti-Air Build:**
1. Aerial Specialization (vs early air)
2. Range Enhancement
3. Elite Marksman

**Aggressive Build:**
1. Assault Mode (frontline conversion)
2. Situational follow-up

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Arclight** | Excellent | Arclight clears chaff so Marksmen shoot priority targets |
| **Vulcan** | Good | Vulcan handles swarms that threaten Marksmen |
| **Stormcaller** | Good | Both backline units benefit from similar positioning |
| **Any Frontline** | Good | Marksmen need meat shields to operate safely |
