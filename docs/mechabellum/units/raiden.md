# Raiden

## Overview

The Raiden is a giant flying unit that fires 3 high-damage lightning bolts at 3 different targets per attack. Think of it as a flying Scorpion - it hard counters all medium units and, with levels and items, eventually counters everything.

The Raiden is incredibly fragile for a giant unit, with even less base HP than the old Overlord and lacking defensive techs like Armor Enhancement or Field Maintenance. However, it can inflict unbelievable amounts of damage if not dealt with quickly.

### Chain Lightning Mechanics

**Multi-Target Lightning:**
- Fires 3 high-damage lightning bolts per attack (5,027 damage each)
- Each bolt targets a different enemy
- If only 1 target available, loses 2/3 damage output
- Designed to devastate groups of medium units

**Chain Lightning (Tech):**
- Range reduced by 20m
- Each bolt jumps to enemies within 60m radius
- Jump deals 25% of original damage
- Each bolt jumps once (3 primary targets + 3 chain targets = 6 total)
- Extends effective range through chaining
- Can reach backline units via jump connections

**Fork (Tech):**
- Range reduced by 10m
- Increases bolts from 3 to 5 per attack
- Not recommended with Chain (combined range loss)
- Choose one or the other, not both

**Ionization (Tech):**
- Base damage reduced by 70%
- Each hit deals additional 50% of target's current HP (updated from 40%)
- Devastating against super-tanky units
- Melts high-rank War Factories and giants with Super-Heavy Armor
- Best against high-HP targets, weak against chaff

**EMP (Tech):**
- Causes electromagnetic interference on hit
- Disables target's Tech upgrades
- Reduces movement speed by 40%
- Hits multiple targets = multiple disables
- Shuts down all Raiden counters effectively

**Fragility:**
- Less HP than old Overlord (pre-Season 2)
- No Armor Enhancement tech available
- No Field Maintenance tech available
- Relies on damage output for survival, not tankiness

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Electromagnetic Shot (EMP)** | 300 | Causes electromagnetic interference on hit, disabling Tech and reducing movement speed by 40%. |
| **Ionization** | 100 | ATK -70%, but attacks cause additional damage equal to 40% of target's current HP. |
| **Chain** | 300 | Range -20m, lightning bolts jump to enemies within 60m radius, dealing 25% damage. |
| **Fork** | 250 | Range -15m, increases lightning bolts from 3 to 5 per attack. |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Attack range +40m. |

### Tech Analysis

**Range Enhancement** - Essential as first tech. Raiden is a backline carry unit, so range keeps it safe and enables faster damage when rounds start. Also increases damage output by allowing more targets in range (Raiden loses 2/3 damage if only one target is available).

**Chain Lightning** - The go-to second tech. Kills all chaff and most medium/small units easily. Attacks can reach further than normal range by jumping. Connects faster to light backline counters like Phoenix or Marksmen.

**EMP (Electromagnetic Shot)** - Because Raiden hits multiple targets, EMP is insane. It shuts down every counter Raiden has. Usually your third tech after Range and Chain - takes time to get there but devastating when achieved.

**Ionization** - Cuts base damage by 70% but adds 40% current HP damage per hit. Gives incredible burst against super-tanky units like high-rank War Factories or giants with Super-Heavy Armor item.

**Fork** - Increases bolts from 3 to 5 but reduces range. Chain Lightning is almost always better, and teching both reduces range sometimes too much.

## Counters

### What Beats Raiden

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Rhino (Armor)** | Hard Counter | Single high-HP unit wastes Raiden's multi-target |
| **Sandworm (Armor)** | Hard Counter | Same as Rhino - tanky single target |
| **Crawler (Mass)** | Strong Counter | Swarms distract while anti-air kills Raiden |
| **Fortress (Anti-Air)** | Strong Counter | Build Fortress same turn or before Raiden |
| **Overlord** | Good Counter | Eventually kills Raiden in air combat |
| **Phoenix** | Good Counter | Needs chaff clear advantage |
| **Marksman** | Good Counter | Needs chaff clear advantage |

### What Raiden Beats

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Sledgehammer** | Hard Counter | Multi-target devastates medium units |
| **Steel Ball** | Hard Counter | Perfect target for lightning bolts |
| **Fire Badger** | Hard Counter | Medium units get destroyed |
| **Phantom Ray** | Hard Counter | Multi-target shreds grouped units |
| **Medium Units** | Hard Counter | Raiden's primary role |
| **High-HP Giants (Ionization)** | Good Counter | 40% current HP damage melts tanks |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Look for Medium Overcommitment** - Deploy Raiden when enemy overcommits to medium units like Sledgehammers, Fire Badgers, Phantom Rays, or Steel Balls.

2. **Standard Build Order** - Range first, then Chain, then EMP. If enemy is aggressive, go Chain first.

3. **Carry Potential** - With levels and items, Raiden eventually counters everything. Invest in it as a carry unit.

### Defensive Use

1. **Backline Positioning** - Raiden is a backline carry. Position it safely behind your army.

2. **Maintain Multiple Targets** - Raiden hits 3 targets; if only 1 target is available, you lose 2/3 damage output. Keep enemies spreading out or multiple threats in range.

3. **Protect from Single Tanks** - Don't let enemy Rhino or Sandworm body-block your Raiden. Clear them with other units.

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Carry Build:**
1. Range Enhancement (first for safety)
2. Chain Lightning (multi-target devastation)
3. EMP (shut down counters)

**Anti-Tank Build:**
1. Range Enhancement
2. Ionization (40% current HP damage)
3. Chain Lightning

**Aggressive Build:**
1. Chain Lightning (if enemy is in your face)
2. Range Enhancement
3. EMP

### Common Mistakes

- **Going Fork instead of Chain** - Chain is almost always better. Fork + Chain together reduces range too much.
- **No Chaff Clear** - Raiden struggles against chaff early. Build Crawlers while killing Raiden with single anti-air unit.
- **Late Fortress** - Fortress Anti-Air needs to be built same turn or before enemy gets Raiden.

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Crawler** | Excellent | Crawlers distract while Raiden deals damage |
| **Chaff Clear** | Excellent | Raiden needs help vs swarms early |
| **Melting Point** | Good | Covers different threats |
| **Scorpion** | Good | Both anti-medium specialists |

## Strengths

- Highest multi-target damage dealer
- Hard counters all medium units
- Lightning bolts hit 3+ targets simultaneously
- Chain Lightning extends effective range
- EMP shuts down all counters
- Ionization melts high-HP tanks
- Air unit - safe from ground-only attacks
- Scales incredibly well with levels and items

## Weaknesses

- Extremely fragile for a giant unit (16,065 HP)
- Less HP than old Overlord
- No defensive techs (no Armor Enhancement, no Field Maintenance)
- Struggles against chaff early game
- Single tanky units waste multi-target damage
- Requires significant tech investment
- Countered by early Fortress Anti-Air
- Loses 2/3 damage with only 1 target in range
- Slow attack interval (4.6s) means burst windows matter
