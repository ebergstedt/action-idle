# Melting Point

## Overview

The Melting Point is one of the weirdest units in Mechabellum - exceedingly overpowered yet also notoriously underpowered at the same time. It has one role and fulfills that role with ruthless efficiency: melting single-entity units with massive health pools.

This spider tank fires an energy beam that builds up damage over time. A level 1 Melting Point at maximum burn is guaranteed over 34K DPS - roughly 10x any other giant unit at level 1 and 5x a War Factory. It doesn't matter how much HP or defense the opponent has; nothing can stop Melting Points' beam once it reaches full power.

## Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Cost** | 400 Supply |
| **Unlock Cost** | 100 |
| **Unit Count** | 1 per squad |
| **Unit HP** | 25,133 |
| **Attack Damage** | 1 - 9,000 (ramping) |
| **Attack Interval** | Continuous beam |
| **DPS (Maximum)** | 34,000+ at full burn |
| **Time to Max DPS** | ~5 seconds |
| **Time to 1M Damage** | ~36 seconds |
| **Range** | 90m |
| **Speed** | 6 m/s |
| **Target** | Ground and Air |

### Weapon Mechanics

**Ramping Beam Damage:**
- Beam starts at minimal damage and ramps up exponentially
- Takes approximately 4 seconds for first instance of maximum damage
- After 4 seconds, reaches maximum damage every 2 seconds
- Beyond 6 seconds, maximum damage applied continuously
- At full burn: 34,000+ DPS (10x other giants, 5x War Factory)

**Damage Ramp Timeline:**
| Time | Damage State |
|------|-------------|
| 0-4s | Building to first max damage tick |
| 4-6s | Max damage every 2 seconds |
| 6s+ | Continuous maximum damage |
| 36s | Cumulative 1,000,000 damage dealt |

**Retargeting Penalty:**
- Switching targets resets damage ramp completely
- Must rebuild damage from minimum
- Vulnerable to swarms that force constant retargeting
- Crawlers and Fangs exploit this weakness

**Energy Absorption (Tech):**
- HP increased by 40%
- Converts 90% of damage dealt to HP (lifesteal)
- At 34K+ DPS, heals faster than most units can damage
- Allows victory against multiple squads if not swarmed

**Energy Diffraction (Tech):**
- Fires 5 beams instead of 1
- Each beam deals 17% damage (85% total if all hit same target)
- Range reduced by 30m
- Better against small groups of durable targets (Steel Balls, Sledgehammers)

*Note: Stats may vary based on game version and balance patches.*

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Energy Absorption** | 200 | HP +40% and converts damage dealt to HP (lifesteal). |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Attack range +40m. |
| **Crawler Summoning** | 300 | Produces 10 Crawlers every 30s. |
| **Electromagnetic Barrage** | 300 | Launches 16 EMP shots every 13s. 4,000 damage to shields, slows targets, disables Tech for 13s. Range 180m. |
| **Armor Enhancement** | 200 | HP +35% and 60 damage blocked (+60/level). |
| **Energy Diffraction** | 250 | Fires 5 rays at 17% damage each instead of single beam. Range -30m. |

### Tech Analysis

**Range Enhancement** - Typically the first tech choice. Essential for fighting long-range units that would otherwise threaten the Melting Point. Keeps your beam safe while it builds damage.

**Energy Absorption** - Makes Melting Point nearly invincible once it starts dealing damage. The lifesteal at 34K+ DPS heals faster than most units can damage. Excellent against Fortresses.

**Crawler Summoning** - Good option if massing Melting Points. The Crawlers provide chaff protection and distraction.

**Electromagnetic Barrage** - Very strong late game for clearing shields quickly. Good against heavily-shielded compositions.

**Energy Diffraction** - Alters the beam to be more effective against small groups of durable enemies like Steel Balls or Sledgehammers. Trades range for multi-target capability.

**Armor Enhancement** - Standard defensive option for extra survivability.

## Counters

### What Beats Melting Point

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Crawler** | Hard Counter | The biggest weakness - swarms force constant retargeting |
| **Fang** | Hard Counter | Same as Crawlers - too many targets |
| **Wasp** | Hard Counter | Air swarm, MP cannot target air |
| **Mustang** | Strong Counter | Against heavy air-focus opponents |
| **Hacker** | Good Counter | Hacks small units causing constant retargeting |
| **Scorpion (Acid)** | Good Counter | Several Scorpion techs beat MP |
| **Marksman** | Good Counter | Outranges and deals high single-target |
| **Stormcaller** | Good Counter | Outranges MP |

### What Melting Point Beats

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Fortress** | Hard Counter | Beam melts even heavily-armored Fortress |
| **Vulcan** | Hard Counter | Melting Point hard counters Vulcan |
| **Giants** | Hard Counter | Designed to melt single-entity units |
| **War Factory** | Strong Counter | High-HP targets are ideal |
| **Overlord** | Strong Counter | Can melt Overlords from range |
| **High-HP Units** | Strong Counter | Any single-entity unit gets destroyed |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Target High-HP Units** - Melting Point's entire purpose is melting single-entity units. Point it at Fortresses, War Factories, and other giants.

2. **Let Beam Build** - The damage ramps up exponentially. Takes ~5 seconds to reach full burn. Protect your MP during this window.

3. **Range First** - Almost always take Range Enhancement first to keep MP safe while beam builds.

### Defensive Use

1. **Stay Behind Frontline** - Despite size and Energy Absorption, Melting Points are NOT frontline units. Position them behind other units.

2. **Clear Chaff First** - Let your army clear chaff before Melting Point engages. Constant retargeting wastes its damage buildup.

3. **Protect from Swarms** - Always have chaff clear to protect from Crawlers and Fangs.

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Build:**
1. Range Enhancement (first for safety)
2. Energy Absorption (vs giants)
3. Crawler Summoning (if massing MPs)

**Anti-Giant Build:**
1. Range Enhancement
2. Energy Absorption
3. Armor Enhancement

**Anti-Shield Build:**
1. Range Enhancement
2. Electromagnetic Barrage
3. Energy Absorption

**Multi-Target Build:**
1. Energy Diffraction (vs Steel Balls, Sledges)
2. Range Enhancement (to offset range loss)

### Positioning

Never leave Melting Points undefended. They weren't designed to be frontline fighting forces - their role is to be a supporting unit behind your front lines.

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Vulcan** | Excellent | Vulcan clears chaff so MP can focus giants |
| **Crawler** | Excellent | Crawlers protect MP from enemy swarms |
| **Arclight** | Good | Arclight handles medium units |
| **Fortress** | Good | Fortress tanks while MP deals damage |

## Strengths

- Highest sustained DPS in the game (34K+ at max burn)
- Destroys any single-entity unit regardless of HP/armor
- Energy Absorption provides incredible sustain
- Hard counters Fortress and Vulcan
- Good answer to enemy shields and barriers
- Beam shreds through any defense

## Weaknesses

- Extremely vulnerable to swarms (Crawlers, Fangs)
- Struggles against high unit-count squads
- Vulnerable to units that outrange it (Marksman, Stormcaller)
- No air targeting capability
- Beam needs time to build up damage
- Constant retargeting resets damage buildup
- Not a frontline unit despite size
