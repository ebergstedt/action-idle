# Abyss

## Overview

The Abyss is a Flying Titan that uses lasers to sweep the battlefield, dealing devastating blows to enemy units in a large area. It is THE most destructive normal unit in the game, being far more offense-focused than the more support-oriented War Factory.

This huge, bulbous machine drifts ominously above the battlefield as the largest flying unit in the game - its bulk makes it several times larger than even the Overlord. Its primary weapon is a devastating laser ray that sweeps across the ground or cuts through the air, dealing massive damage to everything it touches. It also features secondary weapons including the Disintegration blast and Swarm Missiles (both require tech upgrades).

## Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Cost** | 800 Supply |
| **Unlock Cost** | 350 |
| **Unit Count** | 1 per squad |
| **Unit HP** | 66,955 (133,910 if elite recruited) |
| **Attack Damage** | 3,859 per hit |
| **Attack Type** | Sweeping Laser Beam |
| **Attack Interval** | 4.0s per sweep |
| **DPS** | ~965 (base, varies by target size) |
| **Range** | 100m |
| **Speed** | 10 m/s |
| **Target** | Ground and Air |
| **Upkeep** | 200 Supply/round |

*Note: Elite recruitment doubles HP to ~133,910. Beam damage varies significantly based on target size - larger units receive many more hits per sweep.*

### Laser Beam Mechanics

**Sweeping Laser:**
- Primary weapon is devastating laser ray
- Sweeps across ground or cuts through air
- Deals damage 20 times across ~160 meters over 2 seconds
- Wide arc coverage hits multiple targets per sweep
- Does not have ramping damage like Melting Point

**Multi-Hit Mechanics:**
- Larger targets sustain more hits per sweep
- Small units (Sledgehammers): ~1 hit per sweep
- Large units (War Factory): ~11 hits per sweep
- Effective DPS scales dramatically with target size
- Beam starts far to the left of target, then sweeps

**Beam Targeting:**
- Beam sweeps in arc, not single-target lock
- Hits all enemies caught in sweep path
- Most effective against grouped formations and large units
- Less efficient vs spread-out compositions or small units
- Crawlers can sometimes dodge the beam if running toward it

### Disintegration Blast (Tech Required)

**Percent HP Damage:**
- Fires huge purple blast every 15 seconds
- Hits ALL ground enemies within 250m radius
- Deals 20% of target's current HP as damage
- Also slows affected enemies by 40% for 5 seconds

**Disintegration Mechanics:**
- Percent damage scales with enemy HP
- More effective against high-HP targets
- Cannot actually kill units (only % current HP)
- Multiple Abyss stack devastatingly (3x = ~45% HP)
- Now fires immediately at battle start (patched)

**Important Note:**
- 20% current HP, not max HP (changed from 30% in early patch)
- Diminishing returns on repeated casts
- Ground targets only

### Swarm Missiles (Tech Required)

**Missile Barrage:**
- Launches 46 missiles every 15 seconds
- 200m range
- 400 base damage per missile
- Targets all nearby ground enemies
- More missiles than most AM systems can intercept

**Targeting Behavior:**
- Missiles spread across multiple targets
- Good for thinning swarms and chaff
- If all lock single target, deals massive burst damage
- Ground targets only (missiles don't hit air)

### Weaknesses

**Lower HP for Titan:**
- 66,955 HP is low compared to War Factory (113,593)
- Vulnerable to concentrated anti-air fire
- Elite recruitment doubles HP to ~133,910
- Air unit status makes it easy target for aerial specs
- Weak against personal shields (Fangs, Wasps, shielded Phantom Rays)

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Disintegration** | 400 | Fires huge purple blast every 15s beneath Abyss. Hits all ground enemies in 250m radius. Deals 20% current HP damage and slows by 40% for 5s. |
| **Swarm Missiles** | 500 | Launches 46 missiles every 15s toward all nearby ground enemies. 200m range, 400 damage per missile. |
| **Dark Companion** | 300 | Summons 1 Wraith at battle start. |
| **Vertical Sweep** | 350 | +50% ATK. Laser sweeps vertically instead of horizontally (better vs backline units). |
| **Range Enhancement** | 500 | Attack range +40m. |
| **Photon Coating** | 300 | Damage -30% for 30s, immunity to EM, ignition, acid, and degeneration effects. |
| **Wreckage Recycling** | 300 | +20% ATK. Restores HP equal to defeated enemy's HP. |

### Tech Analysis

**Swarm Missiles** - Considered the most effective tech. The 46 missiles every 15 seconds provide excellent chaff clear and pressure across the battlefield. 400 damage per missile adds up quickly.

**Disintegration** - The signature percent-damage ability. Deals 20% current HP to everything in a massive 250m radius every 15 seconds. Excellent against multiple giants or titans. The 40% slow helps Abyss continue hitting targets. Now activates immediately at battle start.

**Vertical Sweep** - Situational tech. +50% ATK and changes beam to vertical sweep, better for hitting backline units like Marksmen. Some players consider it underwhelming but it can be oppressive with range enhancement.

**Range Enhancement** - Take this when Abyss starts taking damage. Keeps the titan safe from counter-fire.

**Dark Companion** - Spawns 1 Wraith at battle start. Provides additional air presence and debuff capabilities. Note: An unteched Wraith becomes less useful after round 4.

**Wreckage Recycling** - +20% ATK and HP restoration on kills. Good sustain option if Abyss can secure kills.

**Photon Coating** - Defensive option providing immunity to status effects for 30 seconds.

### Tech Priority

Tech choice depends on enemy composition:
- **Lots of chaff** = Swarm Missiles first
- **Lots of medium/large units** = Disintegration first (also helps hit things due to slow)
- **Enemy backline threats** = Vertical Sweep + Range Enhancement

## Counters

### What Beats Abyss

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Crawler (Mass)** | Hard Counter | Swarms overwhelm beam targeting |
| **Aerial Spec Units** | Strong Counter | Abyss is air, easily targeted by anti-air |
| **Phoenix** | Strong Counter | Long-range air attacks |
| **Marksman (Aerial)** | Good Counter | High single-target damage |
| **Mustang (Aerial)** | Good Counter | Fast anti-air pressure |

### What Abyss Beats

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Giants (Multiple)** | Hard Counter | Beam + Disintegration devastates giants |
| **Titan Units** | Strong Counter | Percent damage melts high-HP targets |
| **Ranged Units** | Strong Counter | Beam sweeps destroy backlines |
| **High-HP Units** | Strong Counter | Disintegration deals 20% current HP |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Late Game Investment** - Abyss works best late game when you have enough supply to buy two and tech them with missiles to clear chaff swarms.

2. **Anti-Giant Role** - Deploy Abyss when enemy has multiple giants or titans. The percent damage and beam devastate high-HP compositions.

3. **Double Abyss** - One base Abyss without tech isn't worth it. Invest in multiples with tech for full effectiveness.

### Defensive Use

1. **Pair with Chaff Clear** - Abyss will deal with most single-unit types. Support with anti-chaff units like Hounds and Fire Badgers.

2. **Lock onto High HP** - Abyss is most effective when it locks onto high-HP units rather than getting distracted by chaff.

3. **Protect from Anti-Air** - Like all flying titans, Abyss is vulnerable to dedicated anti-air focus.

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Build:**
1. Swarm Missiles (chaff clear)
2. Disintegration (percent damage)
3. Range Enhancement (safety)

**Anti-Giant Build:**
1. Disintegration (first for max HP damage)
2. Range Enhancement
3. Swarm Missiles

**Aggressive Backline Build:**
1. Swarm Missiles
2. Range Enhancement
3. Vertical Sweep (hit their backline AA)

**Support Build:**
1. Dark Companion (Wraith spawn)
2. Swarm Missiles
3. Disintegration

### Best Practices

- Pair with good chaff clear so Abyss can focus on high-HP targets
- Favorites for support: Hounds and Fire Badgers
- Not optimal in 1v1 where better uses of money exist in mid-to-late rounds
- Pretty decent in 2v2 and 4-player matches
- Multiple Abyss with Disintegration stacks devastatingly (3x = ~45% HP to entire enemy board)
- One base Abyss without tech investment is not worth it

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Hound** | Excellent | Provides chaff clear so Abyss focuses giants |
| **Fire Badger** | Excellent | Same as Hound - chaff clear support |
| **Anti-Chaff Units** | Excellent | Any unit that clears small targets |
| **Wraith (Dark Companion)** | Good | Self-synergy with spawning tech |
| **Multiple Abyss** | Excellent | Disintegration stacks (3x = ~45% HP to entire board) |

## Strengths
