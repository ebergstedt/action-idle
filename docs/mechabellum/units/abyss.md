# Abyss

## Overview

The Abyss is a Flying Titan that uses lasers to sweep the battlefield, dealing devastating blows to enemy units in a large area. It is THE most destructive normal unit in the game, being far more offense-focused than the more support-oriented War Factory.

This huge, bulbous machine drifts ominously above the battlefield as the largest flying unit in the game - its bulk makes it several times larger than even the Overlord. Its primary weapon is a devastating laser ray that sweeps across the ground or cuts through the air, dealing massive damage to everything it touches. It also features secondary weapons including the Disintegration blast and Swarm Missiles.

## Stats

### Laser Beam Mechanics

**Sweeping Laser:**
- Primary weapon is devastating laser ray
- Sweeps across ground or cuts through air
- Continuous damage to everything it touches
- Wide arc coverage hits multiple targets per sweep
- Does not have ramping damage like Melting Point

**Beam Targeting:**
- Beam sweeps in arc, not single-target lock
- Hits all enemies caught in sweep path
- Most effective against grouped formations
- Less efficient vs spread-out compositions

### Disintegration Blast (Tech)

**Percent HP Damage:**
- Fires huge purple blast every 15 seconds
- Hits ALL ground enemies within 250m radius
- Deals 20% of target's current HP as damage
- Also slows affected enemies for 5 seconds

**Disintegration Mechanics:**
- Percent damage scales with enemy HP
- More effective against high-HP targets
- Cannot actually kill units (only % current HP)
- Multiple Abyss stack devastatingly (3x = ~45% HP)
- Starts on cooldown - doesn't fire immediately

**Important Note:**
- 20% current HP, not max HP
- Diminishing returns on repeated casts
- Some sources report 25% (may have been patched)

### Swarm Missiles (Tech)

**Missile Barrage:**
- Launches 46 missiles every 15 seconds
- Targets all nearby ground enemies
- More missiles than most AM systems can intercept
- Excellent chaff clear capability

**Targeting Behavior:**
- Missiles spread across multiple targets
- Good for thinning swarms
- If all lock single target, deals massive burst
- Ground targets only (missiles don't hit air)

### Weaknesses

**Lower HP for Titan:**
- 80,000 HP is low compared to War Factory (146,782)
- Vulnerable to concentrated anti-air fire
- Elite recruitment doubles HP to 160,000
- Air unit status makes it easy target for aerial specs

*Note: Stats may vary based on game version and balance patches.*

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Disintegration** | 300 | Fires huge purple blast every 15s beneath Abyss. Hits all ground enemies in 250m radius. Deals 20% current HP damage and slows for 5s. |
| **Swarm Missiles** | 300 | Launches 46 missiles every 15s toward all nearby ground enemies. |
| **Mothership** | 300 | Periodically produces Wasps to support in combat. |
| **Wraith Spawning** | 350 | Spawns Wraiths to support in combat. |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Attack range +40m. |

### Tech Analysis

**Swarm Missiles** - Considered the most effective tech. The 46 missiles every 15 seconds provide excellent chaff clear and pressure across the battlefield.

**Disintegration** - The signature percent-damage ability. Deals 20% current HP to everything in a massive 250m radius every 15 seconds. Excellent against multiple giants or titans. The slow helps Abyss continue hitting targets.

**Range Enhancement** - Take this when Abyss starts taking damage. Keeps the titan safe from counter-fire.

**Mothership** - Produces Wasps periodically for support and distraction.

**Wraith Spawning** - Noted as potentially powerful for providing additional air presence and debuff capabilities.

### Tech Priority

Tech choice depends on enemy composition:
- **Lots of chaff** = Swarm Missiles first
- **Lots of medium/large units** = Disintegration first (also helps hit things due to slow)

## Counters

### What Beats Abyss

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Crawler (Mass)** | Hard Counter | Swarms overwhelm beam targeting |
| **Aerial Spec Units** | Strong Counter | Abyss is air, easily targeted by anti-air |
| **Phoenix** | Strong Counter | Long-range air attacks |
| **Marksman (Aerial)** | Good Counter | High single-target damage |
| **Mustang (Aerial)** | Good Counter | Fast anti-air pressure |

### What Abyss Beats

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Giants (Multiple)** | Hard Counter | Beam + Disintegration devastates giants |
| **Titan Units** | Strong Counter | Percent damage melts high-HP targets |
| **Ranged Units** | Strong Counter | Beam sweeps destroy backlines |
| **High-HP Units** | Strong Counter | Disintegration deals 20% current HP |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Late Game Investment** - Abyss works best late game when you have enough supply to buy two and tech them with missiles to clear chaff swarms.

2. **Anti-Giant Role** - Deploy Abyss when enemy has multiple giants or titans. The percent damage and beam devastate high-HP compositions.

3. **Double Abyss** - One base Abyss without tech isn't worth it. Invest in multiples with tech for full effectiveness.

### Defensive Use

1. **Pair with Chaff Clear** - Abyss will deal with most single-unit types. Support with anti-chaff units like Hounds and Fire Badgers.

2. **Lock onto High HP** - Abyss is most effective when it locks onto high-HP units rather than getting distracted by chaff.

3. **Protect from Anti-Air** - Like all flying titans, Abyss is vulnerable to dedicated anti-air focus.

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Build:**
1. Swarm Missiles (chaff clear)
2. Disintegration (percent damage)
3. Range Enhancement (safety)

**Anti-Giant Build:**
1. Disintegration (first for max HP damage)
2. Range Enhancement
3. Swarm Missiles

**Support Build:**
1. Mothership or Wraith Spawning
2. Swarm Missiles
3. Disintegration

### Best Practices

- Pair with good chaff clear so Abyss can focus on high-HP targets
- Favorites for support: Hounds and Fire Badgers
- Not optimal in 1v1 where better uses of money exist in mid-to-late rounds
- Pretty decent in 2v2 matches

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Hound** | Excellent | Provides chaff clear so Abyss focuses giants |
| **Fire Badger** | Excellent | Same as Hound - chaff clear support |
| **Anti-Chaff Units** | Excellent | Any unit that clears small targets |
| **Wraith (Spawning)** | Good | Self-synergy with spawning tech |

## Strengths

- Most destructive offensive unit in the game
- Devastating laser beam sweeps entire areas
- Disintegration deals 20% current HP (percent damage)
- 250m radius on Disintegration blast
- Swarm Missiles (46 missiles) provide area pressure
- Effective against multiple giants and titans
- Largest flying unit - imposing presence
- Attacks both ground and air

## Weaknesses

- Lower HP compared to War Factory titan
- As air unit, easily targeted by aerial specializations
- Vulnerable to massed Crawlers and swarms
- Expensive (800 supply + 200 upkeep)
- Requires tech investment to be worthwhile
- One base Abyss without tech underperforms
- Less optimal in 1v1 compared to 2v2
- Needs chaff clear support to focus high-value targets
