# Void Eye

## Overview

The Void Eye is a mid-range support/diver unit with suppression capabilities and optional flight. It functions as a glass cannon - low HP and range but high attack power, capable of causing significant damage to heavy units at medium range.

Void Eyes are unique in having one of the most distinctive EMP abilities in the game: Electromagnetic Armor, which inflicts EMP on any enemy that attacks them. This makes them particularly effective against units relying on range tech upgrades. They win many matchups but often just barely survive, meaning small advantages like health buffs or additional tech can swing fights significantly.

### Weapon Mechanics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Attack Type** | Ranged (energy cannon) |
| **Projectile** | Charged energy bolt |
| **AoE/Splash** | None (single target) |
| **Targets per Attack** | 1 per Void Eye |

**Combat Notes:**
- Glass cannon: high damage (947) but fragile (1,522 HP per unit)
- Energy Absorption is the only free (0-cost) tech in the game (+40% HP, lifesteal)
- Lifesteal capped by target's max HP - healing is poor vs chaff
- Electromagnetic Armor disables enemy tech for 5 seconds when attacked
- Suppression Shots reduce enemy range and reset Steel Ball/Melting Point charging
- With Energy Absorption: ~9,900 squad HP and ~5,500 squad damage for 150 cost

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Energy Absorption** | 0 | +40% HP, restores health based on damage dealt. The only free tech in the game. |
| **Electromagnetic Armor** | Variable | EMPs any enemy that attacks Void Eyes for 5 seconds, disabling their tech. |
| **Suppression Shots** | Variable | Reduces enemy range. Can reset Steel Ball/Melting Point charging and Hacker progress. |
| **Aerial Mode** | Variable | Transforms Void Eyes into flying units. |
| **Charged Shot** | 200 | Significantly increases damage. Excellent for clearing mid-size units at level 2+. |
| **Range Enhancement** | Variable | Increases range to 140m (155m with Suppression Shots). |
| **Improved Void Eye** | Variable | +40% ATK, +40% HP, +5 range. Increases cost by 50. |

### Tech Analysis

**Energy Absorption** - The only 0-cost tech in Mechabellum. Provides +40% HP and lifesteal based on damage dealt. Excellent if it's the only tech you plan to use. However, it adds 200 cost to subsequent techs and has diminishing returns - healing is capped by the target's max HP (shooting a Fang only heals a few hundred HP, not 1000+). In late rounds (round 9+), this tech lets Void Eyes maintain full strength as they eat away at enemy chaff.

**Electromagnetic Armor** - The most unique EMP in the game. Any enemy that attacks armored Void Eyes loses their tech for 5 seconds. Crippling against units like upgraded Melting Points and Mustangs, which lose Range Enhancement immediately upon attacking. Also counters Marksmen, siege Scorpions, Phoenixes, Stormcallers - anything hiding behind chaff.

**Suppression Shots** - Reduces enemy range and resets charging mechanics on Steel Balls and Melting Points, or cancels Hacker hacking progress. Strong utility tech for disrupting enemy strategies.

**Aerial Mode** - Transforms Void Eyes into air units. Provides mobility and safety from ground-only threats but exposes them to anti-air.

**Charged Shot** - At level 2, the 200-cost Charged Shot makes Void Eyes excellent at clearing mid-size units like Sledgehammers and Steel Balls.

**Range Enhancement** - Brings range to 140m, making Void Eyes safer. With Suppression Shots, can reach 155m.

**Improved Void Eye** - The full upgrade package (+40% ATK, +40% HP, +5 range) at cost of 50 more supply per deployment.

## Counters

### What Beats Void Eyes

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Mustang** | Hard Counter | Fast, numerous, overwhelms Void Eyes |
| **Marksman** | Hard Counter | Outranges significantly |
| **Phoenix** | Hard Counter | Air mobility and burst damage |
| **Crawler** | Hard Counter | Swarms overwhelm low DPS |
| **Sabertooth** | Good Counter | Secondary Armament tech specifically counters Void Eyes |
| **Giants (with armor)** | Good Counter | -35% damage reduction is brutal; Void Eye damage already low mid-late |
| **Tanks (leveled)** | Good Counter | Armor negates Void Eye damage |

### What Void Eyes Beat

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Arclight** | Good Counter | Electromagnetic Armor disables techs |
| **Hound** | Good Counter | Void Eyes handle Hounds well |
| **Long-range builds** | Good Counter | EMP Armor punishes range-reliant compositions |
| **Tech-dependent units** | Good Counter | Disabling tech is devastating |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Anti-Sniper** - Electromagnetic Armor counters backline units that rely on range upgrades. Position Void Eyes to bait attacks from Marksmen and Melting Points.

2. **Suppression Utility** - Use Suppression Shots to reset Steel Ball and Melting Point charging, or cancel Hacker progress.

3. **Mid-Size Clearer** - At level 2 with Charged Shot, Void Eyes efficiently clear Sledgehammers and Steel Balls.

### Defensive Use

1. **EMP Shield** - Position Void Eyes with Electromagnetic Armor to protect your army from tech-reliant enemy units.

2. **Energy Absorption Sustain** - In long, chaotic battles (round 9+), Energy Absorption lets Void Eyes self-heal while clearing chaff.

3. **Range Reduction** - Suppression Shots reduce incoming fire range, potentially saving backline units.

### Tech Build Recommendations

**Free Tech Only:**
1. Energy Absorption (sustain, no cost)

**Anti-Sniper Build:**
1. Electromagnetic Armor
2. Range Enhancement

**Damage Build:**
1. Charged Shot
2. Range Enhancement

### Positioning Notes

- Void Eyes are fragile (barely 1000 HP per unit) - keep them protected
- Defensively excellent but offensively limited due to range and HP
- EMP Armor works best when enemies attack into you
- With Elite Specialist providing free 40% HP buff from tech, Void Eyes can reach impressive stats for 150 money

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Frontline Tanks** | Good | Void Eyes deal damage while tanks absorb |
| **Chaff Clearers** | Good | Need protection from swarms |
| **Anti-Air Units** | Good | Cover Void Eyes' Phoenix weakness |
| **Other Support** | Moderate | Void Eyes are niche; build around their strengths |

## Strengths

- Unique Electromagnetic Armor EMPs attackers, not targets
- Energy Absorption is the only free tech in the game
- High attack power relative to cost
- Can target both ground and air
- Suppression Shots disrupt enemy strategies
- Aerial Mode provides flexibility
- Strong against tech-reliant compositions

## Weaknesses

- Extremely fragile (barely 1000 HP per unit)
- Base range of 100m is low
- Damage output poor vs armored giants
- Hard countered by common units (Mustang, Crawler, Phoenix)
- Energy Absorption adds cost to other techs
- Offensively weak; better defensively
- Requires careful positioning to survive
