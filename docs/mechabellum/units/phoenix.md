# Phoenix

## Overview

The Phoenix is a long-range, flying unit that excels at dealing high single-target damage to both air and ground units. Phoenixes share many similarities with Marksmen - both are fragile, long-range damage dealers designed to take out single targets.

However, while more expensive than Marksmen, Phoenixes move much faster and can fly - attacks from Sledgehammers and Stormcallers that would threaten Marksmen won't affect them. Phoenixes also have higher damage per shot, letting them kill durable units like Sledgehammers more efficiently.

### Weapon Mechanics

**Attack Type:** High-damage single-target projectile

**Combat Characteristics:**
- **Glass Cannon:** Extremely high damage per shot, but low HP
- **Attack/HP Ratio:** Damage per shot exceeds own HP - among highest in game
- **Flight:** Flying unit provides immunity to ground-only attacks
- **Long Range:** Outranges most ground units

**Damage Profile:**
- Single-target focused damage
- High damage per shot kills medium units efficiently (can one-shot Mustangs)
- Effective against slow, high-HP targets that can't escape or return fire quickly

**Revive Mechanic - Quantum Reassembly:**
- When a Phoenix is destroyed, its cockpit follows the nearest surviving allied Phoenix
- After approximately 15-20 seconds, the Phoenix is fully restored
- **Limit:** Each Phoenix can only revive once per battle (recently nerfed)
- **Counter:** EMP on the killing blow prevents the revive from triggering
- **Requirement:** At least one other Phoenix must survive for revive to activate

**Tech Effects on Stats:**
- **Jump Drive:** +5 m/s movement speed, free repositioning
- **Charged Shot:** +175% damage, -25m range
- **Launcher Overload:** -50% attack interval, -25m range
- **Energy Shield:** Shield equal to HP (blocks at least one hit)
- **Elite Marksman:** +5m range and +25% ATK per level (up to +75% at Level 3)

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Jump Drive** | 50 | Increases movement speed by 5 m/s, allows free repositioning during deployment. Very powerful early game. |
| **Charged Shot** | 200 | Damage increased by 175%, range decreased by 25m. Good vs shields, Rhinos, and Wraiths. |
| **Electromagnetic Shot** | 200 | Causes electromagnetic interference on hit, disabling target tech and reducing movement speed by 40%. |
| **Energy Shield** | 200 | Obtain energy shield equal to HP that blocks at least one instance of damage. |
| **Launcher Overload** | 250 | Attack interval reduced by 50%, range decreased by 25m. Good for defending pushes or pushing yourself. |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Increases attack range by 40m. |
| **Quantum Reassembly** | 300 | Destroyed Phoenix cockpit follows nearest ally, fully restored in 15s. Triggers only once per battle. |
| **Elite Marksman** | 400 | Increases range by 5m and ATK by 25% per level. |

### Tech Analysis

**Jump Drive** - Considered one of the best technologies for Phoenix. Very powerful when you start the game with Phoenixes or buy them round 1. Position aggressively, flank with them, and move them around to counter enemy Rhinos. The mobility is exceptional.

**Charged Shot** - Mostly used against shields, Rhinos, and Wraiths. Sometimes useful against Overlords and highly leveled medium units like Steel Balls or Sledgehammers. The range reduction requires careful positioning.

**Electromagnetic Shot (EMP)** - Gives Phoenixes the ability to apply Electromagnetic debuff, drastically slowing enemy movement and disabling upgrades. Good counter to Multi-Diffraction Melting Points.

**Energy Shield** - Provides a shield equal to max HP that always blocks at least one instance of damage. Good survivability tech.

**Launcher Overload** - The 50% attack interval reduction is significant. Good for both defending against pushes and pushing yourself, though range reduction requires closer positioning.

**Quantum Reassembly** - Unique tech that revives one Phoenix per battle after 15 seconds. Can provide an extra Phoenix when you need it most.

**Elite Marksman** - Final upgrade that scales with levels. At Level 3, provides 15m extra range and 75% ATK increase. Excellent on high-level carry Phoenixes.

## Counters

### What Beats Phoenixes

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Mustang** | Hard Counter | Consistent damage and high unit count shred Phoenixes |
| **Fortress** | Good Counter | With anti-air capabilities, tough for Phoenixes |
| **Wasp** | Good Counter | Can tank Phoenix damage or kill with Aerial Spec |
| **Marksman** | Good Counter | Trades well due to similar role |
| **Fang** | Good Counter | Anti-air capability |

### What Phoenixes Beat

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Arclight** | Hard Counter | Stationary, can't respond to flying threats |
| **Overlord** | Hard Counter | Flying high-damage counters slow air units |
| **Rhino** | Hard Counter | Can kite Rhinos with Jump Drive |
| **Stormcaller** | Hard Counter | Flying, can't be targeted by rockets |
| **Vulcan** | Hard Counter | Struggles against fast air |
| **Typhoon** | Hard Counter | Slow, vulnerable to air attacks |
| **Sabertooth** | Good Counter | Outranges and outdamages |
| **Fire Badger** | Good Counter | Can't target air |
| **Scorpion** | Good Counter | Single-target ground unit vulnerable to air |
| **Squad Units** | Good Counter | No real answer to air attacks |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Flanking Force** - Phoenixes should almost always be used as a flanking force. Their main goal is to take out precious Single-Entity units like Hackers.

2. **Early Aggression with Jump Drive** - Jump Drive is very powerful when you start with Phoenixes or buy them round 1. Position aggressively, flank, and reposition to counter enemy Rhinos.

3. **Squad Unit Destruction** - Phoenixes are quite good at taking out Squad units, as those have no real answer to attacks from the air.

### Defensive Use

1. **Anti-Giant** - Use Phoenixes to take down high-value single targets like Hackers, Scorpions, and Melting Points.

2. **Overlord Counter** - With proper positioning, Phoenixes can take down Overlords before they deal significant damage.

### Tech Build Paths

**Mobility Build (Early Game):**
1. Jump Drive
2. Range Enhancement or Charged Shot

**Damage Build:**
1. Charged Shot
2. Elite Marksman

**Anti-Tech Build:**
1. Electromagnetic Shot
2. Range Enhancement

**Survivability Build:**
1. Energy Shield
2. Range Enhancement

### General Advice

- Many players value mobility on Phoenix and consider them an early game unit that needs to be played aggressively.
- Common approaches: Jump Drive for mobility, EMP to counter Multi-Diffraction Melting Points, or Charged Shot against Rhinos or Wraiths.
- Phoenixes are threatened by Mustangs - their consistent damage and high unit count allow Mustangs to shred Phoenixes while taking few casualties.
- Always consider flanking opportunities - Phoenixes excel when attacking from unexpected angles.
