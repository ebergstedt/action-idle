# Crawler

## Overview

The Crawler is one of the most versatile and iconic units in Mechabellum. These small quadrupedal robots feature a large drill on the front and charge across the battlefield in massive swarms to tear apart anything they can reach. Crawlers are cheap, fast, expendable, and absolutely terrifying once they unlock their powerful upgrades.

Crawlers excel at swarming single-target units, drawing fire from valuable units, and with the right technologies, can become a devastating force that replicates itself from fallen enemies.

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Impact Drill** | 200 | Increases ATK by 125%. Essential for killing larger units. |
| **Replicate** | 250 | Destroyed enemies become Crawlers. Arguably the best tech in the game. |
| **Mechanical Rage** | 200 | Increases movement speed by 5 m/s and reduces attack interval by 0.4s. |
| **Subterranean Blitz** | 300 | Increases speed by 3 m/s, tunnels underground when no enemies within 50m (nullifies 50% damage), emerges to attack near enemies. |
| **Acidic Explosion** | 200 | Destroyed Crawlers leave acidic liquid in 9m radius. Units in acid lose 6% HP/sec and have reduced DEF. |
| **Loose Formation** | 400 | Spreads units out to reduce AOE damage effectiveness. Reduces HP by 40%. |

### Tech Analysis

**Impact Drill** - The go-to damage upgrade. Increases damage by 125%, allowing Crawlers to chew through giants, Sledgehammers, and other high-HP units. Take this if enemies lack proper Crawler counters.

**Replicate** - Considered by many to be the best technology in the entire game. Any enemy unit killed by your Crawlers becomes a Crawler itself. This creates a snowball effect where small advantages become overwhelming victories. Master Replicate timing and you will climb ranks quickly.

**Mechanical Rage** - Usually taken as a third tech after Replicate and Impact Drill. The combination of faster movement (connecting to targets quicker) and reduced attack interval creates devastating DPS.

**Subterranean Blitz** - A standalone tech choice. Provides survivability against AOE and fire units. Best used as the only tech when facing Mustangs or Flamers. The 50% damage reduction while burrowed helps Crawlers reach their targets.

**Acidic Explosion** - Situational tech against giants like Fortress and War Factory. The DOT and DEF reduction can swing fights against heavy armor.

## Counters

### What Beats Crawlers

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Arclight** | Hard Counter | Can one-shot Crawlers and has enough attack speed to clear swarms |
| **Vulcan** | Hard Counter | Rapid-fire AOE devastates Crawler swarms |
| **Stormcaller** | Hard Counter | Long-range AOE wipes out groups |
| **Overlord** | Hard Counter | Massive AOE attacks |
| **Wraith** | Strong Counter | Air unit with good AOE; best answer to teched Crawlers |
| **Mustang** | Good Counter | Fast enough to kite and has decent AOE |

### What Crawlers Beat

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Melting Point** | Hard Counter | Single-target damage wasted on swarms |
| **Marksman** | Hard Counter | Single-target, overwhelmed by numbers |
| **Hacker** | Hard Counter | Single-target, easily swarmed |
| **Fang** | Good Counter | Crawlers can close distance and overwhelm |
| **Scorpion** | Good Counter | Single-target artillery, vulnerable to swarms |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Drip Feed Tactic** - Deploy Crawlers incrementally to absorb fire and protect valuable units behind them.

2. **Replicate Farming** - Position Crawlers to kill isolated enemy units on the flanks. Each kill snowballs into more Crawlers.

3. **Surprise Tech Rush** - Keep Crawlers without upgrades early, then buy 2 techs (Impact Drill + Replicate) in a single turn to catch opponents off-guard.

4. **Flank Positioning** - Place Crawlers on the sides of the battlefield to attack artillery and backline units.

### Defensive Use

1. **Meat Shields** - Crawlers in front absorb shots meant for your damage dealers.

2. **Bait Positioning** - Place a forward Fang in front of your Vulcan to draw enemy Crawlers into kill zones.

3. **Sell Isolated Units** - If enemy has Replicate, sell your isolated or dying units so they cannot be farmed.

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Carry Build:**
1. Replicate (if food available)
2. Impact Drill
3. Mechanical Rage

**Anti-AOE Build:**
1. Subterranean Blitz (only tech)

**Anti-Giant Build:**
1. Impact Drill
2. Acidic Explosion

### Mirror Match (Crawler vs Crawler)

- Level 2 Crawler always beats Level 1 Crawler with any tech
- At Level 1: Impact Drill > Replicate > Mechanical Rage

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Fortress** | Excellent | Fortress with Crawler Summoning creates endless swarms |
| **Hound** | Good | Hound with Fire Extinguisher protects Crawlers from fire damage |
| **Overlord** | Good | Overlord clears opposing AOE threats |
| **Any Single-Target Unit** | Good | Crawlers absorb fire, allowing damage dealers to survive |

## Strengths

- Large squad size (24 units) overwhelms single-target damage
- Extremely cheap (100 supply)
- Replicate tech can snowball into game-winning swarms

## Weaknesses

- Very low individual HP; vulnerable to any AOE damage
- Melee-only; must close distance to deal damage
- Hard countered by Arclight, Vulcan, and other AOE units
- Replicate can be denied by smart opponents selling units
- No air targeting capability
