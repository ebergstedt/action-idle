# Fortress

## Overview

The Fortress is a large and powerful giant unit that uses massive shoulder-mounted cannons to inflict single-target damage on grounded targets from a long distance. Unlike the similarly-ranged Marksman, whose upgrades focus on combat ability, the Fortress offers a vast array of upgrades that allow it to fulfill a variety of roles.

Fortresses can face off against any units you put them up against, and they have the biggest health pool in the game. This means they can both dish out and withstand significant punishment, making them one of the most versatile units in Mechabellum.

### Tech Analysis

**Anti-Air Barrage** - The most important Fortress technology. Allows you to counter troublesome boards that would otherwise require multiple answers, like Ball/Wasp pushes or Boat/Sledge compositions.

**Rocket Punch** - Changes matchups against Crawlers, Fangs, Steel Balls, Stormcallers, and Sandworm. Provides chaff clear against Replicate swarms or forces enemies to deal with ground threats.

**Barrier** - Combined with Armor Enhancement, allows Fortress to sponge heavy damage and draw AOE attacks away from fragile units.

**Launcher Overload** - Very strong for clearing chaff and medium units quickly. Usually needs Range tech to compensate for the range reduction.

**Fang Summoning** - Turns Fortresses into Fang factories, producing fodder every 28 seconds. Great for soaking enemy fire and protecting from single-target damage.

**Elite Marksman** - Increases range and damage with levels. Good for carry Fortress builds.

**Range Enhancement** - Allows Fortress to engage from safer distances. Essential for many builds.

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Look for Overcommitment** - Deploy Fortress when enemy overcommits to air units (Phoenix) or medium units (Sledgehammer, Typhoon).

2. **Rocket Punch vs Replicate** - Use Rocket Punch to clear ground chaff, allowing Fortress to focus on valuable targets.

3. **Weapons Platform** - With Range Enhancement and Doubleshot, turn Fortress into a devastating artillery piece.

### Defensive Use

1. **Damage Sponge** - Barrier and Armor Enhancement let Fortress absorb heavy damage and protect fragile units behind it.

2. **Anti-Air Coverage** - Anti-Air Barrage provides reliable air defense for your entire composition.

3. **Fang Factory** - Fang Summoning creates endless fodder to distract enemy units.

### Tech Build Paths

**Anti-Air Build:**
1. Anti-Air Barrage (first for air coverage)
2. Range Enhancement
3. Barrier or Armor Enhancement

**Tank Build:**
1. Barrier
2. Armor Enhancement
3. Fang Summoning

**Artillery Build:**
1. Range Enhancement
2. Launcher Overload
3. Doubleshot or Elite Marksman

**Anti-Crawler Build:**
1. Rocket Punch
2. Range Enhancement
3. Anti-Air Barrage (for complete coverage)

### Cost Considerations

Fortresses are expensive (400 supply). You cannot spam them carelessly. Carefully decide when and where to place Fortresses based on the enemy composition.

## Synergies
