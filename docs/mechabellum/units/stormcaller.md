# Stormcaller

## Overview

The Stormcaller is the designated artillery unit of Mechabellum. These painfully slow missile platforms have arguably the best mob-clearing potential in the game. If unopposed, Stormcallers are one of the best units available - they melt down all low-HP units and are excellent against slow or stationary targets.

Stormcallers reign as Mechabellum's ultimate artillery, raining destruction on clustered foes and shattering shields from afar. While fragile, their unmatched AOE power and range make them game-changers when properly protected from counters.

### Weapon Mechanics

**Attack Type:** Unguided rocket barrage (artillery)

**Rocket Mechanics:**
- **Rockets per Attack:** 4 rockets per unit (2 from left arm, 2 from right arm)
- **Projectile Speed:** Very slow, "drifting through the sky"
- **Projectile HP:** 42,000 (can be intercepted by Missile Intercept tech)
- **Guidance:** Unguided - rockets fire at target's position at launch time
- **Splash Pattern:** Each rocket has 5.5m splash radius, creating overlapping damage zones
- **Interceptable:** Yes - Mustangs, Sabertooths, and War Factory with Missile Intercept tech can shoot down rockets

**Damage Distribution:**
- Each Stormcaller fires 4 rockets per volley
- Each arm fires 2 rockets dealing approximately 860 combined damage
- Individual rocket damage: ~430 per rocket
- Full volley from one Stormcaller: 772 x 4 = 3,088 damage
- Full squad volley (4 units): 12,352 total damage spread across target area

**Projectile Evasion:**
- Fast units (16 m/s) like Crawlers, Rhinos, Steel Balls easily outrun rockets
- Units with speed boosts can evade significant rocket damage
- Stationary or slow units take full damage

**Minimum Range:** Cannot attack adjacent units - targets that close to melee range destroy Stormcallers unopposed

**Tech Effects on Splash:**
- **High-Explosive Ammo:** +5m splash radius, -40% ATK
- **Incendiary Bomb:** Creates 5.5m radius fire zone for 15s, dealing 350 DPS

## Technologies

| Tech | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **High-Explosive Ammo** | 200 | Increases splash range by 5m, reduces ATK by 40%. Usually the first choice for chaff clear. |
| **Incendiary Bomb** | 350 | Ignites an area of 5.5m radius for 15s, dealing 350 damage per second. Allied forces vulnerable to this damage. |
| **Electromagnetic Explosion** | 300 | Temporarily disables target's tech and reduces movement speed by 40%. Good vs War Factory, Mechanical Division Steel Balls. |
| **Armor-Piercing Bullets (HEAT)** | 200 | ATK increases by 100%, attack interval increases by 15%. Not recommended - makes missiles more interceptable. |
| **Launcher Overload** | 300 | Attack interval reduced by 50%, range reduced by 40m, movement speed increased by 5 m/s. Good vs missile intercept. |
| **Range Enhancement** | 300 | Increases attack range by 40m. Key when enemy deploys long-range units. |

### Tech Analysis

**High-Explosive Ammo** - Usually the first choice. Clears chaff (even Crawlers) very reliably, it's cheap, and you have the option to commit into Crawlers since there's no fire damage. Damage reduction is inconsequential against Mobs but noticeable against Squad units.

**Incendiary Bomb** - Late game tech for when the enemy starts summoning Fangs, or when you need to ignite an Oil patch to win a round. Be careful - allied forces are vulnerable to the fire.

**Electromagnetic Explosion (EMP)** - Very useful against specific techs: War Factory, Multi-Diffraction Melting Point, Mechanical Division Steel Balls, etc. Unfortunately, when you need EMP you REALLY need it, and it can get intercepted.

**Armor-Piercing Bullets (HEAT)** - Never tech this. It makes your Stormcallers more easily interceptable while providing damage you typically don't need.

**Launcher Overload** - Good specifically against missile intercept technologies. The faster fire rate with shorter range helps missiles get through before being shot down.

**Range Enhancement** - Key for when enemies begin deploying long-range units (Fortresses, opposing Stormcallers). Lets you outrange threats.

## Counters

### What Beats Stormcallers

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Overlord** | Hard Counter | Air unit Stormcallers can't hit, massive damage |
| **Phoenix** | Hard Counter | Flying, can't be targeted, destroys artillery |
| **Crawler** | Hard Counter | Fast enough to get inside minimum range and destroy them |
| **Rhino** | Hard Counter | Outruns rockets, closes distance to melee range |
| **Steel Ball** | Hard Counter | Fast enough to outrun unguided rockets |
| **War Factory** | Good Counter | Can sustain and push through rocket damage |
| **Missile Intercept Tech** | Hard Counter | Any unit with this tech neutralizes Stormcallers |
| **Sledgehammer** | Good Counter | Can tank rockets and push forward |
| **Sabertooth** | Good Counter | With Missile Intercept tech, shuts down Stormcallers |

### What Stormcallers Beat

| Unit | Effectiveness | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Fang** | Hard Counter | AOE devastates grouped Fangs |
| **Mustang** | Hard Counter | Slow enough to get hit by rockets |
| **Arclight** | Hard Counter | Stationary targets are easy prey |
| **Marksman** | Hard Counter | No mobility, grouped for easy kills |
| **Melting Point** | Hard Counter | Stationary, slow |
| **Vulcan** | Hard Counter | Big target, slow to reposition |
| **Fortress** | Hard Counter | Slow, takes massive damage from rockets |
| **Scorpion** | Hard Counter | Stationary artillery loses to longer-range artillery |
| **Typhoon** | Hard Counter | Slow ground target |
| **Sledgehammer** | Good Counter | Slow movement means consistent hits |
| **Giants** | Good Counter | Few Stormcallers deal enough damage to threaten even giants |

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Use

1. **Early Game Investment** - It's acceptable to buy 2-4 packs of Stormcallers early. They force enemies to build counters or lose units.

2. **Never Over-Invest** - Fear anti-missile devices or War Factory Anti-missile tech. Don't invest more than necessary, think twice about leveling them, and never put items on them.

3. **Distraction Tactics** - Cost-efficiently, you can distract Stormcallers with a couple packs of Crawlers running around taking all the missiles, granting your other units time to move forward. You can put one Crawler in the middle of the board and Mobile Beacon it to move sideways.

### Defensive Use

1. **Counter Chaff** - Stormcallers are excellent at clearing enemy Fangs, Mustangs, and Crawlers.

2. **Shield Breaker** - One of the best units for bringing down enemy shields.

3. **Zone Denial** - Their massive AOE creates danger zones that slow or stationary units cannot safely occupy.

### Tech Build Paths

**Standard Build:**
1. High-Explosive Ammo (usually the only tech needed)

**Anti-Tech Build:**
1. Electromagnetic Explosion

**Counter Long-Range:**
1. Range Enhancement

**Anti-Intercept Build:**
1. Launcher Overload

### General Advice

- Stormcallers are NOT a unit you want to tech heavily. Usually zero or one tech is recommended.
- Never invest items or excessive levels - their value lies in forcing costly enemy adaptations.
- Use sparingly, strike decisively, and abandon them the moment interceptors flood the field.
- Stormcaller rockets are unguided and take time to reach targets. Fast units naturally outrun them.
- Units with increased speed can evade some rockets, noticeably decreasing damage output.
- Stormcallers can't attack adjacent units - anything that gets inside minimum range will destroy them.

## Synergies

| Unit | Synergy | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Sledgehammer** | Excellent | Sledges protect Stormcallers from fast units |
| **Fang** | Good | Fangs provide anti-air protection |
| **Mustang** | Good | Covers air weakness, can intercept missiles shot at Stormcallers |
| **Fortress** | Good | Tanks while Stormcallers deal damage |

## Strengths

- Best mob-clearing potential in the game
- Excellent against low-HP units (Fangs, Mustangs)
- Great against slow or stationary targets
- One of the best units for destroying shields
- High single-target damage can threaten even giants
- Long attack range
- Forces enemies to invest in counters

## Weaknesses

- Painfully slow movement speed
- Cannot attack air units at all
- Cannot attack adjacent units (minimum range)
- Rockets are unguided and can be evaded
- Fast units (Crawlers, Rhinos, Steel Balls) outrun rockets
- Hard countered by Missile Intercept technology
- Fragile when enemies close distance
