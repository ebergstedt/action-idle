## Counter Matrix (Tier 1)

## Implementation Notes

### Scale Adjustments for Our Game

Our arena is smaller than Mechabellum's, so some values are adjusted:

| Property | Mechabellum | Our Game | Notes |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Splash Radius | 7m | ~7 pixels | Scaled ~80% smaller |
| Range | 95m | 95 pixels | ~1:1 |
| Speed | 16 m/s | 16 pixels/s | ~1:1 |

### Attack Speed Conversion

Mechabellum uses **attack interval** (seconds between attacks).
Our game uses **attackSpeed** (attacks per second).

```
attackSpeed = 1 / attackInterval
```

| Unit | Interval | attackSpeed |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Crawler | 0.6s | 1.67 |
| Fang | 1.5s | 0.67 |
| Arclight | 0.9s | 1.11 |
| Marksman | 3.1s | 0.32 |
| Hound | 2.4s | 0.42 |
| Void Eye | 3.3s | 0.30 |
| Wasp | 1.4s | 0.71 |
| Phoenix | 3.4s | 0.29 |
| Fortress | 1.8s | 0.56 |
| Melting Point | 0.2s | 5.00 |
| Overlord | 4.6s | 0.22 |
| Sandworm | 2.5s | 0.40 |
| Wraith | 1.6s | 0.63 |
| Raiden | 4.6s | 0.22 |
| War Factory | 1.8s | 0.56 |
| Abyss | 4.0s | 0.25 |

## Notes

1. **All stats are exact values** from the Mechabellum Wiki (wiki.mbxmas.com) as of February 2026
2. **HP and damage scale with unit level** - values shown are base level 1
3. **Balance patches frequently adjust values** - verify against in-game for current patch
4. **DPS calculations** are theoretical maximums (damage / interval * squad size)
5. **Ramping weapons** (Steel Ball, Melting Point) have variable DPS based on engagement time
6. **Multi-target weapons** (Raiden, Wraith, War Factory) may exceed stated DPS against multiple enemies
