## How the Tech System Works

### Research Level and Tech Points

- **Research Level**: Players gain research/advanced level points by playing matches (win or lose, including vs bots)
- **Tech Points**: Earned when your research level increases
- **Research Cap**: Level 74 is the current cap for tech point unlocks
- **Total Unlocks**: There are 42 unlockable techs in the game
- **Time to Unlock All**: Approximately 20 hours of gameplay (roughly one unlock per 45 minutes on average)
- **Post-Cap Rewards**: After level 74, you gain credits instead of tech points

### Tech Cost System

Tech costs use a "Tech Tax" system:

| Tech Purchase | Cost Formula | Example (base 100) |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1st tech | Base cost | 100 |
| 2nd tech | Base + 200 | 300 |
| 3rd tech | Base + 400 | 500 |
| 4th tech | Base + 600 | 700 |
| Maximum | Capped at | 1000 |

**Key Points:**
- Cost increases only apply to that specific unit type
- Order doesn't matter for total cost (buying 300 then 50 = buying 50 then 300 = 550 total)
- **Strategy**: Buy expensive techs first before they inflate beyond affordability

### Unit Deployment

- **Supply**: Increases by 200 points every round (starting at 200)
- **Deployment Slots**: Limited to 2 new units per round (can be increased with cards)
- **Each unit has 4+ tech upgrades available**

**Matchup Changes with Rocket Punch**: Crawlers, Fangs, Steel Balls, Stormcallers, Sandworm

### Vulcan

| Tech | Cost | Effect | Priority |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| **Ignite** | - | Fire actually sets enemies on fire | Must unlock |

**Role**: Anti-Light Bot specialist (Crawlers, Fangs, Mustangs)

### War Factory

| Tech | Cost | Effect | Priority |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| **Missile Interception** | - | Equivalent to 4-6 AM devices | Core utility |
| **Phoenix Production** | - | 6 Phoenixes over the round | Cover air weakness |
| **Efficient Maintenance** | - | -150 upkeep (200 -> 50) | Economy |

**Notes**:
- 200 upkeep is the biggest weakness
- Don't deploy before round 5 (economy reasons)
- Produced units match War Factory's level (not level 1)
- Best use: Missile interceptor device

### Giant Strategy Tips

1. **Buy giants at level 2 immediately** - Level 1 giants are very weak
2. **Level 3 giant with 2 techs + item** can nearly solo enemy teams
3. **Use Giant Specialist** for free unlocks (no supply cost)
4. **Fortress counters**: Melting Point (hard counter), EMP Melters + Incendiary Vulcans
5. **Vulcan counters**: Fortress with shields

## Specialist System

### How Specialists Work

- **Starting Specialists**: Choose 1 of 4 options at match start (don't overlap with opponent)
- **Total Specialists**: 16 types
- **Effects**: Passive perks, starting units, HP modifiers, supply bonuses
- **Mid-Game Specialists**: Available from reinforcements starting round 2

### Starting Specialist Overview

| Specialist | Key Benefit | Playstyle |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Supply Specialist** | +50 supply per round | Future-proof, late game scaling |
| **Cost Control** | +100 credits/round, -13% stats | Flexible adaptation, early giants |
| **Elite Specialist** | Units start at level 2 | Different economy, harder to master |
| **Aerial Specialist** | Free air unlocks, +10m range | Aggressive air play |

| **Rhino Specialist** | Free unlock + unit (350 saved) | +10% ATK per kill |
| **HP/Heavy Armor** | +17% HP all units | Straightforward tankiness |
| **Marksman Specialist** | Level 3 Marksman start | Counter Phoenix/Wraith early |

### Specialist Synergies

- **Giant Specialist + Vulcan**: Zero-cost Melting Point follow-up
- **Aerial Specialist + Wasp/Phoenix**: Permanent range boost
- **Cost Control + Early Giants**: Flexible early power spikes

## Tech Strategies and Tips

### When to Tech vs Buy More Units

#### Tech When:
- **Unit already winning** matchups (enhance advantage)
- **Limited deployment slots** (upgrading uses no slots)
- **Specific counter needed** (Anti-Air, EMP, Anti-Missile)
- **Unit scales well with levels** (Melting Point is "COMPLETELY busted" at 4-5)
- **Board space limited** (late game)

#### Buy More Units When:
- **Units dying quickly** (leveling dead units = "feeding" enemy XP)
- **Unit already one-shots targets** (overkill is wasteful)
- **Need board presence** (early-mid game)
- **Opponent can counter single unit type** (spread risk)

### Tech Investment Rules

1. **Buy expensive techs first** - Before inflation prices you out
2. **Percentages scale with levels** - Level up first, then tech for multiplied benefit
3. **Opponent can't sell tech** - Your counter-tech forces their adaptation
4. **Every tech increases other tech costs** - Plan your tech path

### Counter-Tech Awareness

| If Opponent Has | Consider |
|-----------------|----------|
| Heavy tech investment | EMP to disable |
| Shield techs | EMP or high-burst damage |
| Missile units | Anti-Missile tech |
| Melting Points | Steel Balls (tank for giants) |
| Fire/Ignite | Armor Enhancement |
| EMP | Photon Emission, chaff, shields |

### Late Game Tech Spending

- **Cheap units (Fang/Crawler)**: Level doesn't matter much late game
- **Better to buy missiles (50) than level chaff**
- **Focus tech spending on carry units**

## Key Tech Synergies

### Top Unit + Tech Combos

| Combo | Why It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| **Fang + Portable Shield + Rage + AP** | 1458 DPS with survival |
| **Mustang + Range + Anti-Missile** | Safe positioning, counter missiles |
| **Crawler + Replicate + Impact Drill + Rage** | Snowball army |
| **Sledgehammer + Field Maintenance** | Nearly unkillable vs Stormcallers |
| **Stormcaller + High-Explosive + EMP** | Chaff clear + tech disable |
| **Phoenix + Jump Drive + Charged Shot** | Mobile anti-everything |
| **Overlord + Launcher Overload + Range** | Avoid interception, maintain distance |
| **Arclight + Charged Shot + AA + Armor** | Anti-medium, anti-air, anti-Mustang |
| **Fortress + Rocket Punch + Fang Summon** | AoE devastation + air cover |

### Unit Pairing Synergies

| Pairing | Synergy |
|---------|---------|
| **Fangs + Typhoon** | Typhoon clears chaff, Fangs distract |
| **Fire Badger + Farseer** | Range + Missile Interception |
| **Steel Ball + Wasp** | Tank front, damage from air |
| **Phoenix + Steel Ball** | Phoenix kills Steel Balls fast (need Charged Shot vs leveled) |
| **Tarantula + Phoenix** | Easy pairing with HE tech for chaff |
| **Tarantula + Scorpion** | Chaff clear + tank killer |

### Counter-Composition Techs

| Facing | Tech Solution |
|--------|---------------|
| Mass Crawlers | Subterranean Blitz, Fire, High-Explosive |
| Mass Fangs | Portable Shield (ironic), Typhoon, Fire |
| Rhino Rush | Hacker, Steel Ball, Wasp (ground damage), Phoenix (Charged Shot + Jump) |
| Fortress Spam | Melting Point, EMP Melters, Incendiary Vulcan |
| Melting Point | Steel Balls (tank), burst damage |
| Sandworm | Steel Balls, MPs (sometimes distracted), Overlord Ground Cannon |
