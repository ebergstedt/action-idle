# Armored Core 6 Theming Suggestions

Future naming and theming ideas to further align with AC6's industrial mech aesthetic.

## Unit Naming Conventions

AC6 uses technical/military designations with model numbers. Current names could map to:

| Current | AC6-Style Suggestion | Role | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|------|-------|
| Hound | HC-07 HOUND | Assault | Bipedal medium AC, balanced stats |
| Fang | LR-12 FANG | Light Ranged | Lightweight frame, hit-and-run |
| Crawler | SW-04 CRAWLER | Swarm | Tank treads or quad legs, low profile |
| Arclight | HA-18 ARCLIGHT | Artillery | Heavy bipedal, shoulder cannons |
| Marksman | SP-09 MARKSMAN | Sniper | Lightweight reverse-joint legs |
| Void Eye | RC-15 VOID EYE | Recon | Tetrapod with sensor suite |

### Naming Pattern
- **Two-letter prefix**: Unit class (HC=Heavy Combat, LR=Light Ranged, SW=Swarm, HA=Heavy Artillery, SP=Sniper, RC=Recon)
- **Two-digit number**: Model designation
- **Name**: Evocative callsign

### Alternative Names (More AC6 Feel)
| Current | Alternative | Inspiration |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Hound | STRIDER | Standard AC movement |
| Fang | NEEDLE | Precise attacks |
| Crawler | CATAPHRACT | Armored swarm |
| Arclight | SIEGE | Heavy bombardment |
| Marksman | STILETTO | Precision elimination |
| Void Eye | SPECTER | Ghost reconnaissance |

## Team/Faction Theming

**Enemy Faction: CRIMSON STAR INDUSTRIES (CSI)**
