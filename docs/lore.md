# VEST (Vested Exchange Standard)

V.E.S.T (Vested Exchange Scrip)
In this setting, the concept of "national" money has completely collapsed. Instead, the currency represents a claim on resources owned by a conglomerate.

The Lore: V.E.S. isn't a coin or a digital credit; it is a "Vesting Note." When you hold V.E.S., you own a microscopic fraction of a corporation's physical assets—be it oxygen, fuel, or scrap metal.

The Hook: It is "Vested," meaning the money only has value as long as the company that issued it still controls territory. If a rival corporation wipes out a V.E.S. issuer’s factory, the currency in your pocket becomes worthless overnight.

The Aesthetic: Digital balances that fluctuate based on the "Stock Value" of the company you are currently working for.
